"French consultancy Capgemini's latest report has found automation is vastly under-estimated by energy companies around the world
Automation began entering the oil and gas industry in the 1990sDespite 81% of all energy companies reporting positive results from the use of automation, just 15% have actually used it in their business, according to a new study.The report by , which surveyed 529 global energy firms and utilities, found almost half under-estimated the benefits of the technology.Just a little over 20% in the US have introduced intelligent automation initiatives, however, compared with 16% in France and India, and just 8% in the UK.Meanwhile, it showed just 20% of oil and gas firms around the world are using automation at scale, while just 6% of water companies are doing the same.The report read: “, deregulation and decentralisation are having a significant impact.“Currently only 10% of UK’s electricity comes from coal-fired generators, and in 2019
the National Grid has logged more than 1,000 hours of coal-free electricity.“The sector is moving from its conservative, regulated past to a new future where innovation is key.“Its consumer base, which used to be largely passive, has now moved to a world of
‘prosumers’ who expect a sophisticated, service-based industry – digitalisation will be critical to capitalising on these shifts.“Technologies, such as automation and AI, are playing a pivotal role in managing the balance between demand and supply, boosting efficiencies in all the entirety of the value chain, innovating the customer experience and transforming business models.”In terms of boosting operations, topline growth and engaging customers, Capgemini’s report suggests  for the energy companies around the world that have already implemented it into their business models.It highlighted that utilities, specifically, recorded higher value from the technology than the average of respondents from all industries, with 40% of executives in the sector reporting an increase in operations quality, as opposed to 30% across all businesses.Meanwhile, 45% had seen a rise in inbound customer leads (27% for all sectors), 81% had had improved the customer experience through faster responses (60% for all sectors) and 32% had seen an increased in staff productivity (26% for all sectors).The numbers showcased in its report have led Capgemini to estimate the energy sector can save between $237bn (£188bn) to $813bn (£646bn) from introducing intelligent automation at scale.Abhijeet Bhandare, chief automation officer at US conglomerate General Electric’s power division, said: “We have a very clear filtering criteria defined for automation use cases.“We have close to 200 automation ideas in the pipeline, and on average about 50% to 60% of them will be rejected.“It is important to focus your attention on the remaining 50%, as they will give you the most value.“And you must have the right criteria – whether it is value, efficiencies, cost savings or the opportunity cost.“Organisations should focus on quality over quantity of use cases.”",13 Jun 2019 ,"Just 20% of energy companies are using ‘under-estimated’ automation, finds study",Power,Automation,Features & Analysis,https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/06/energy-companies-automation.jpg

" PwrCor, an advanced technology company focusing on clean, renewable energy solutions for the Waste-Heat-to-Power, Geothermal, and Solar Thermal markets announced that SMU Geothermal Laboratories has completed a significant industry research project that was instrumental in  assessing the potential of PwrCor’s proprietary technology to generate electricity from wasted ultra-low-grade heat (150°F to 250°F) discarded by existing geothermal power facilities.
Image: PwrCor collaborates with SMU Geothermal. Photo: Image by rawpixel from Pixabay.Geothermal production facilities typically return large quantities of ultra-low-grade heat, in the form of spent hot water, into injection wells after the higher heat is used in electricity production. This spent hot water represents fuel to PwrCor’s heat-to-power conversion technology that currently operates within a hot input temperature range between 150° and 250° F. This application of PwrCor technology is commonly referred to as a bottoming cycle and represents a simple, low risk, and low cost point of entry to the geothermal market. PwrCor technology is also uniquely applicable to several other geothermal applications including abandoned geothermal wells, hot springs, new low temperature geothermal plants, as well as existing and abandoned oil and gas wells which typically abound with geothermal energy.SMU’s research team compiled available information such as ambient air temperature, injection temperature, and injection flow rate to quantify the total thermal energy within the spent geothermal fluids already being produced, but not utilized, by 31 of 73 U.S. based geothermal sites for which data were available. These 31 sites represent approximately 2,900 MWe or 78% of U.S. currently installed geothermal electricity capacity.  New calculations indicate an additional 427 MWe, or approximately 15%, can be derived from the spent geothermal fluids utilizing the PwrCor bottoming cycle technology. An additional 100 MWe of output can be conservatively imputed from the remaining installed capacity for which there was insufficient available data.According to a recently published DOE report, as of 2018, geothermal power plants were concentrated in the western United States with the majority located in California and Nevada. Although geothermal energy accounts for only 0.4% of total electricity generation nationwide, it provides 6% of total generation in California and 8% in Nevada. The state of California alone has more installed geothermal capacity than any country in the world. The DOE report summarizes findings showing that geothermal electricity generation could increase more than 26-fold from today – reaching 60 gigawatts (GW) of installed capacity by 2050 – just from known available resources.Utilities are struggling to increase their electricity production from “green” energy sources, with extremely challenging goals being set by regulators and legislatures around the country, while at the same time confronted with the irregular production from the sun and wind. Management believes its PwrCor technology is uniquely positioned to transform ultra-low-grade geothermal heat into useful electricity, thereby contributing a major solution source to this challenge.Maria Richards, Geothermal Lab Coordinator for the Geothermal Laboratory at Southern Methodist University, a research facility devoted to broadening the understanding and use of geothermal energy, stated, “Geothermal energy is the work-horse of green power production.  Unlike various others, it operates 24/7, is suitable for baseload power supply, occupies a small footprint, and is designed to last. PwrCor is working to improve the efficiency of our geothermal power infrastructure, and we commend their efforts.”Joe Batir, Ph.D., Research Geologist for the Geothermal Laboratory at Southern Methodist University, stated, “There is a great deal of heat being underutilized in geothermal power generating facilities around the United States.  Technology that can convert even a small portion of this underutilized heat into additional power has the potential of bringing major benefits to both geothermal power producers and to the environment.”As Halley Dickey, President of Energy Systems Development Group, a privately-held experienced renewable energy and power project development and operator company, noted, “By converting a portion of the heat currently discarded by active geothermal and power facilities, or left unused by inactive wells, PwrCor technology can bring a green solution to bear.  This is a technology the world needs, and something that interests us significantly.”Tom Telegades, CEO of PwrCor, stated, “PwrCor’s technology seeks to change the energy profile of entire industries.”PwrCor’s technology delivers the ability to reduce the overall cost of energy for power users.  Low-grade and ultra-low-grade heat, which up until now could only be discarded and wasted, can be cost-effectively utilized to generate electrical power, providing cost savings and improving bottom line performance.PwrCor is currently engaged with leading companies in such industries as fuel cells and reciprocating engines, and on additional project initiatives in geothermal, oil and gas, solar thermal, and data centers, all of which have enormous amounts of wasted ultra-low-grade heat that can now be converted to additional power, contributing to higher profits.  Our technology cost-effectively converts heat to mechanical power or electricity, and represents a breakthrough for those businesses which can now profit from converting wasted heat into electrical power.Source: Company Press Release",13 Jun 2019 ,PwrCor Collaborates with SMU Geothermal Laboratories to pursue unexploited geothermal application,Power,Geothermal,Technology,https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/06/business-3167295_640-1.jpg

"NEC Energy Solutions (NEC ES) has launched Adaptive Energy Warranty which uses energy storage system usage data to adapt a system's energy capacity warranty to fit a customer's use profile.
Image: Headquarters of NEC in Tokyo Japan. Photo: Courtesy of KW/Wikipedia.NEC’s proprietary, advanced AEROS software platform provides real time usage data to predict energy storage capacity degradation based on different use profiles. The result allows energy storage customers to maximize the value of their power with the knowledge and flexibility to use their system any way they want, without worrying about the warranty. The warranty will adapt depending on the use profile they choose.The energy storage capacity of any battery decreases with time and use. Some of the more important factors that impact energy storage capacity include energy throughput, cell temperature, average state of charge (SOC), depth of discharge (DOD), resting time and charge/discharge rate. Customers need to understand how a system’s energy storage capacity degrades or fades so that they can predict the life and performance of the system. However, due to changing market rules, customers often do not know exactly how they will use their system. NEC’s Adaptive Energy Warranty and its advanced AEROS software platform allows a customer to change their use profile to optimize the system while the warranty adapts accordingly.“Our unique Adaptive Energy Warranty, empowered by our proprietary AEROS software platform, is truly where electricity meets digital. We have over 10 years of data and more than 750MW of energy storage assets around the world that we have used to create mathematical models of energy capacity,” said Steve Fludder, CEO of NEC Energy Solutions. “These models enable our customers to adjust how they operate their systems to optimize value without having to worry about being out of warranty.”Source: Company Press Release",13 Jun 2019 ,NEC introduces Adaptive Energy Warranty to optimize value for energy storage customers,Power,Transmission and Distribution,Storage,https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/06/EPR4-1.jpg

"Oil companies around the world have been investing in renewables for some time now but in 2019 Shell, BP and Chevron look to be upping the pace
Credit: StockSnap/PixabayThree of the world’s biggest oil companies are investing collective billions into renewables in 2019, highlighting what could be the start of a genuine shift towards clean power on the part of the industry’s most established players.Shell, BP and Chevron have all been making headlines so far this year for their proactive investment in carbon neutral energy solutions and acquisition of renewable power firms.It’s a trend that has been underway for some time – , Total incorporated energy efficiency firm GreenFlex and British Petroleum poured money into electric vehicle charging business Freewire.And yet, across the board, Big Oil spent just 1% of its budget on renewable energy last year, with European firms providing most of the capital and accounting for 70% of the installed capacity.The signs so far this year suggest the industry could be looking to improve on this – here we profile the investment trends of three oil giants leaning towards clean energy that make the case.  by 20% by 2035, and then 50% by 2050,In May this year, the oil giant renamed its UK-based energy supplier First Utility to Shell Energy retail, and began serving its British customers with 100% renewable electricity.The newly-named company will also be offering a range of smart home technology over the course of 2019, with the various measures intended to reduce the costs of charging electric vehicles from home.Towards the start of the year, Shell also acquired electric vehicle charging firm Greenlots in a bid to claim a bigger stake in the emerging market.The Anglo-Dutch firm said its new subsidiary will maintain its original brand, but will become the foundation of its electric mobility business in North America., Maarten Wetselaar, director of Shell’s integrated gas and new energies division, said: “It’s mostly driven by the irreversible choice the world has made to decarbonise, to address climate change and to go to a net-zero energy system.“And by far, the easiest form of energy consumption that can be carbon-free is electricity.”“Most of our customers, private individuals and companies, will in the coming decades only be using electricity – so if we’re not in that business, we’ll become marginalised.”“So to an extent, it’s about survival, but it’s also about, of course, playing a positive role in energy transition – we see the two as equally powerful.” Almost 20 years ago to the day, BP announced its “Beyond Petroleum” campaign, which aimed to pour billions of pounds worth of investment in to solar and wind energy, but was ultimately derided by the wider community which labelled it blatant “greenwashing”.Today, the company looks to be gearing up towards a return to renewable energy investment on a similar scale, though it has taken strides to ensure it is more successful this time around.It has announced an aim to generate CO2 emissions reductions equivalent to 3.5m tonnes every year through to 2025, as part of its Advancing the Energy Transition strategy.Various actions have been taken towards that end in recent months, with BP $500m (£390m) in low-carbon projects and technologies by the end of 2019.Earlier this year, the UK-based firm released its energy outlook report, anticipating an increase in the role of renewable energy in the world’s energy mix and outlining its plans to acclimate to this change.: “If someone said here’s $10bn (£7.6bn), go invest it in these new energy technologies, for the good of our shareholders we’re not confident enough to be able to do that yet.” One of the few US oil giants to make substantial investment in the clean energy space, perhaps .Sold on the promise of limiting its own emissions by 40% by burying up to four million tonnes of CO2 each year, the gargantuan facility has yet to make good on its commitment more than three years after it began producing LNG in March 2016.As the project’s developer,  is bound by a deal with the Western Australian government to capture 80% of emissions from a submerged gas field over a five-year period and bury them in its reservoir 2km beneath Barrow Island in Western Australia.The company has been continuing its work to get the CCS element of Gorgon up and running this year, and expects to achieve its goal by the end of 2019.Its emerging technology venture capital arm, Chevron Technology Ventures, also recently invested in electric vehicle charging firm ChargePoint, after having launched its $100m (£76m) fund in June last year dedicated to supporting new clean energy solutions.The president of its

"Researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) estimate that floating solar photovoltaics (PV) on the more than 24,000 man-made reservoirs could generate about a tenth of the country’s annual electricity production.
Image:  Floating PV being installed in Walden, Colorado. Photo: Courtesy of Dennnis Schroeder/NRELThe findings of NREL were published in the journal Environmental Science & Technology. The first installation of floating solar was completed 10 years ago on pontoons on an irrigation pond in Napa Valley, California. But, the idea had not received widespread acceptance across the country, the report noted.In the US, the primary focus has been on large-scale, ground-mounted solar panels, with only seven floating PV sites as of December last yearThe report said that floating solar are being deployed more abroad, with more than 100 sites as of the end of last year.NREL lead energy-water-land analyst and principal investigator of the project that produced the paper ‘Floating PV: Assessing the Technical Potential of Photovoltaic Systems on Man-Made Water Bodies in the Continental U.S.’ Jordan Macknick said: “In the United States, it’s been a niche application; where in other places, it’s really been a necessity.“We’re expecting it to take off in the United States, especially in areas that are land-constrained and where there’s a major conflict between solar encroaching on farmland.”Macknick and his NREL co-authors, Robert Spencer, Alexandra Aznar, Adam Warren, and Matthew Reese estimate that nearly 2.1 million hectares of land could be saved if solar panels were installed on water bodies instead of on the ground.The team has also found that installing floating solar alongside hydroelectric facilities offers increased energy output and cost savings due to the utilization of the existing transmission infrastructure.NREL’s Integrated Applications Center director Warren said “Floating solar is a new industry enabled by the rapid drop in the price of solar PV modules.“The cost of acquiring and developing land is becoming a larger part of the cost of a solar project. In some places, like islands, the price of land is quite high, and we are seeing a rapid adoption of floating solar.”",02 Jan 2019 ,NREL says floating solar could generate tenth of US electricity,Power,Solar,PV,https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/NREL.jpg

"The US Department of Energy (DOE) Water Power Technologies Office (WPTO) is offering a new prize for meeting the global need for safe, secure, and affordable water.
Image: NREL announces competition to power water desalination from waves. Photo: Courtesy of Free-Photos/PixabayThe Waves to Water Prize invites competitors to help accelerate early-stage technologies through a series of contests. Participants will demonstrate small, modular, cost-competitive desalination systems that use the power of ocean waves to supplement existing technologies that can provide drinking water to remote and coastal communities.“The Waves to Water Prize encourages companies, researchers, and investors who might not consider wave energy technologies to explore their application for desalination,” said Scott Jenne, a researcher with NREL’s Marine Energy team who helped inform the structure and content of the competition. “This project is multidisciplinary and a wide array of organizations and researchers should be interested in exploring how wave energy and desalination technology intersects. The new prize allows us to accelerate technological development by bringing in new perspectives of making use of wave energy.”The Waves to Water Prize consists of four stages, culminating in a contest that will require developers to deploy their solutions and compete across a variety of metrics. Graphic by Besiki Kazaishvili, NRELThe competition offers participants $2.5 million in cash prizes to spur innovation in wave energy-powered desalination systems. WPTO looks to support new solutions, designs, and strategies to accelerate technological development in support of three goals:Evaluate the economic basis for small-scale modular wave power desalinationDemonstrate desalination and marine renewable energy integrationValidate technologies in a field test setting that meet quantifiable benchmarks for freshwater production, ease of installation, cost, reliability, and survivability.The new competition explores the application of wave energy outside the context of utility scale electricity, something that proves to be more economical for technological development in the near term. The high premium placed on water availability allows for innovation in wave energy technology because the cost of research and development is outweighed by the need for clean drinking water.“In disaster or crisis scenarios, innovations in desalination technologies that supplement the supply of water using wave or other energy sources have the potential to make real impacts,” said Jenne. “Exploring the use of ocean waves to desalinate water for drinking makes a lot of sense. Fortunately, the energy source (ocean waves) and saltwater are collocated offering an obvious synergy.”Source: Company Press Release",13 Jun 2019 ,NREL announces new competition to develop water desalination powered by waves,Power,Hydro,Wave and Marine,https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/06/EPR3-5.jpg

"The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has agreed to provide $4.5m cluster regional technical assistance grant to support an increase in regional power trade in Central Asia Power System (CAPS).
Image: ADB to grant $4.5m to support cross-border energy trading in Central Asia. Photo: Courtesy of Matthew Bowden/FreeImages.comIt will support in exploring potential reconnection of Turkmenistan to CAPS and its further expansion to Afghanistan.ADB Central and West Asia Department Energy Division Director Ashok Bhargava said: “With increased regional power trade, countries will be able to meet local demand for power and supply surpluses to their neighbors.He further added that this will improve regional energy security and reduce carbon footprints of meeting the regional power demand.Power trade among Central Asian countries has declined dramatically since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. First in 2003, Turkmenistan disconnected from CAPS and then in 2009, Tajikistan was disconnected from CAPS. As a result, compared to 25,413 million kilowatt hour (kWh) traded in CAPS in 1990, the traded energy volume declined to 2,080 million kWh in 2016. This had caused widespread power outages notably in Tajikistan in winter and resulted in increased fossil fuel use by Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan in the summer mainly because hydropower surpluses from Tajikistan were not available to CAPS. Tajikistan has since reconnected to Uzbekistan and to CAPS in March 2018.The TA cluster will include three key subprojects to introduce an energy data management (EDM) system to the Coordinating Dispatch Center (CDC) Energiya to enable a safe increase of energy flow within CAPS; update regional power sector masterplan to identify technical barriers to increased power flow and possible solutions to overcome these barriers; and expand CAPS to Afghanistan and potentially Turkmenistan and identify additional new markets to increase power trade.ADB senior energy specialist Bouadokpheng Chansavat said: “The Central Asian countries lack the institutional and technical capacity to optimally coordinate increased power trade, due to prevailing obsolete technologies and system forecast techniques that constraints real-time monitoring of new power system assets in the region and corresponding adjustments of power flows.”In this regard, the CDC Energiya, which was established in 1960s to coordinate power flows in CAPS need urgent capacity development and technological upgrading.The updating of the regional power sector master plan is timely since its completion in 2012 to take into account the newly completed power assets and evolved geopolitical situation in Central Asia.In 2017, Afghanistan expressed interest to join CAPS as it already trades bilaterally with Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. This technical assistance grant will help assess Afghanistan’s electricity grid and ensure compatibility with CAPS. Options for connection of Turkmenistan back to CAPS will also be explored.The technical assistance cost is $4.5m, $1.5m of which will be financed by ADB on a grant basis; $1m by the Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund; $1m by the Asian Clean Energy Fund; and $1m by the High-Level Technology Fund. The governments will provide counterpart support in the form of staff, office space, and supplies and other in-kind contributions.ADB has committed $7.1bn in loans and $85.9m in technical assistance grants to Uzbekistan since it joined the bank in 1995. Last year, ADB committed four loans totaling $993m to improve power generation efficiency, improve primary healthcare services, support horticulture-related farmers and businesses for fixed asset investments, and support ongoing reforms through better economic management in the country.ADB is committed to achieving a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Asia and the Pacific, while sustaining its efforts to eradicate extreme poverty. Established in 1966, it is owned by 67 members—48 from the region.Source: Company Press Release",08 Jan 2019 ,ADB to grant $4.5m to support cross-border energy trading in Central Asia,Power,Transmission and Distribution,Power Cable,https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/electric-sun-1442715-639x426.jpg

"Researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), and Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) have found a new way to improve efficiency and reduce costs of biofuel production that moves beyond conventional strategies.
Image: Calvin Mukarakate and Kristiina Iisa co-authored the recent Energy and Environmental Science paper that highlights a new CFP approach with increased bio-oil yields and lower costs. Photo: Courtesy of Dennis Schroeder/NREL.A culmination of years of catalyst development research, “Driving towards cost-competitive biofuels through catalytic fast pyrolysis by rethinking catalyst selection and reactor configuration,” was published in  and details the catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) process in which researchers modified catalyst composition and reactor configuration to boost bio-oil yields.One benefit of CFP is its compatibility with a wide variety of lignocellulosic biomass. This feedstock flexibility, coupled with a diverse set of potential products, provides the foundation for a robust biorefinery concept. However, existing CFP processes use zeolite catalysts in riser reactors and suffer from lower than desired bio-oil yields. Recently, researchers from three national labs developed an alternative CFP approach that uses bifunctional catalysts in a fixed-bed reactor configuration and operates at atmospheric pressure. The modifications in catalyst type and reactor configuration have made all the difference in terms of increased bio-oil yields and lower costs.NREL Senior Process Research Scientist Calvin Mukarakate, a co-author of the study said: “Zeolites form a lot of coke. As result they are used in a riser reactor system equipped with inline catalyst regeneration.“In our case, we targeted a catalyst that doesn’t form a lot of coke and can achieve long reaction time on stream in a fixed bed reactor system. We noticed that, in addition to increased reaction times, we saw a significant increase in the yields of upgraded bio-oil compared to standard methods.”A first-of-its-kind technical and economic evaluation of this alternative approach revealed a 50% relative improvement in overall carbon efficiency to fuel blendstocks, as compared to conventional CFP strategies.NREL’s Mike Griffin, a chemical engineer and lead author said: “The techno-economic analysis included in the report provides a unique perspective. The calculations showed that our approach was cost-advantaged compared to conventional CFP processes. That’s really interesting because the catalyst—platinum on titanium dioxide—uses an expensive noble metal.“However, the extended lifetime of the catalyst and the improved carbon yields of the process translated to an overall reduction in the fuel blendstock production cost.”The environmental benefits of the process are also worth noting. Results of a life cycle analysis showed that total supply chain greenhouse gas emissions for the fuel blendstock is approximately 80% lower compared to conventional gasoline.Working in tandem, this multilaboratory team discovered an alternative CFP approach—using fixed-bed reactors and bifunctional catalysts—that significantly improved bio-oil yields and the overall economics of the process.All team members agreed that the project wouldn’t have been as successful without the close collaboration of researchers from the three national labs, all of whom are affiliated with Chemical Catalysis for Bioenergy, or ChemCatBio, a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) national lab-led research and development consortium. Each lab had important and distinct responsibilities:Another advantage to the ChemCatBio collaboration was the ability to use the consortium’s newly developed catalyst cost estimation tool, CatCost, which guided the team to make proper decisions when selecting catalyst formulations.Griffin said: “The tool helped us identify factors like the salvage value of platinum on titanium dioxide catalyst, which ended up having a significant impact on the overall catalyst cost.”Co-author Michael Griffin prepares a batch of Pt/TiO2 catalyst that proved to be effective for the modified CFP process to convert biomass to biofuels and bioproducts. In addition to the positive economic and environmental impacts, this was the first time an integrated biomass-to-blendstock process had been demonstrated for this class of catalysts.NREL Chemical Engineer and co-author Kristiina Iisa said: “We have not seen this full spectrum—going all the way from biomass to gasoline and diesel blendstocks and then measuring the fuel blendstock properties—in other literature. Measuring the quality of the fuel goes beyond what other research has done.”The team analyzed the final blendstock product and discovered that although the properties precluded it from being a stand-alone fuel, the product would be appropriate for blending with petroleum-derived fuels. Griffin is quick to point out that even though this information was not what the researchers hoped for, it helped identify an important technical challenge, as the info was previously unknown to the scientific community.Griffin, Mukarakate, and Iisa believe it is likely that additional performance enhancements and cost reductions can be achieved through further optimization of this early stage process. More research is required to further improve parameters such as catalyst stability, efficient regeneration procedures, and catalyst lifetime.And with the goal of reducing costs, one thing the team is looking at is cheaper feedstocks. The current research uses clean pine, but future work will focus on forest residues and could include other feedstocks such as municipal solid waste and plastics.These process improvements represent an important advancement in the catalytic fast pyrolysis technology and highlight a promising step forward for thermochemical conversion of biomass into fuels and products, thus enabling a sustainable U.S. bioeconomy.Source: Company Press Release",09 Jan 2019 ,NREL scientists find new way to reduce production costs of biofuel,Power,Bioenergy,Technology,https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/20190108-bioenergy-54886.jpg

"PSEG Power has sold the sites of its retired Hudson Generating Station in Jersey City/Secaucus and Mercer Generating Station in Hamilton Township to Hilco Redevelopment Partners (HRP), an operating company within Hilco Global. 
Image: Aerial view of Hudson Generating Station, Jersey City, New Jersey. Photo: courtesy of Xenonice/Wikipedia.org.Both coal-burning power plants were built in the 1960s and retired in June 2017. PSEG is committed to being a leading clean energy provider. Last year, the company set the goal of eliminating 13 million metric tons of CO2-equivalent emissions by 2030 from 2005 levels.After reviewing more than two dozen proposals, PSEG selected Chicago-headquartered HRP based on their strong environmental track record and demonstrated success in managing complex redevelopment projects, including retired coal plants.HRP envisions redeveloping the sites as state-of-the-art industrial parks to serve the growing need for regional warehouse distribution hubs in central and northern New Jersey.PSEG Fossil operations senior vice president John Paul Cowan said: “We hope these sites will continue to be productive assets for the communities that hosted the plants for decades.“That’s why we sought out a buyer that understands the strategic value of both locations and will leverage the great labor pool in the surrounding areas. Hilco Redevelopment Partners has a track record of success taking on both the remediation of these types of industrial facilities and, most importantly, redeveloping them into economic engines for the people who live in and around the sites.”HRP also recently acquired retired coal power facilities from Exelon in Boston and NRG in Chicago.HRP CEO Roberto Perez said: “Our goal with every redevelopment project is to return economic vitality to these dormant industrial sites, giving them a new purpose and generating new strategic opportunities.“The locations of both the Hudson and Mercer sites offer transformational opportunities to reposition underutilized land into modern industrial parks in one of the strongest warehouse/distribution center regions in the entire country.”HRP has several current transactions and ongoing development projects underway, including the following:Tradepoint Atlantic/ Washington, D.C./ Baltimore – HRP purchased the 3,100-acre former home of Bethlehem Steel in Baltimore. Beginning in 2012, HRP demolished and continues to remediate the site while redeveloping it into the largest tri-modal logistics hub on the eastern seaboard of the U.S. Thousands of jobs have already been created with new tenants to Tradepoint Atlantic that include Amazon, FedEx, Under Armour, Volkswagen and more.L-Street Station on Summer Street, Boston – HRP purchased the former Boston Power Generating Station owned by Exelon Corp. HRP is in the process of permitting the site into a multi-phase dynamic mixed-use redevelopment, including residential, hotel, office and retail components.Exchange 55 – Crawford Station, Chicago – In 2017, HRP purchased the decommissioned Crawford Generating Station in Chicago from NRG with a vision to redevelop it into a 1 million-square-foot state-of-the-art warehouse and distribution center, bringing jobs, economic development and significant benefits to the community. Vacant since 2012, the site was rebranded in 2018 as “Exchange 55.” The project is scheduled to be complete in early 2020.HRP’s other projects include redevelopment of The Gauge, a decommissioned manufacturing facility in Waltham, Mass.; modernization of One North LaSalle, updating the tenant amenities of an art deco-era office building in Chicago’s Central Loop; and the decommissioning and redevelopment of numerous other large industrial sites across the country.Hilco global chairman and CEO Jeff Hecktman said: “We’re excited about this acquisition from PSEG.“The Hilco Redevelopment team has developed a strong reputation for taking on these types of large-scale industrial development projects across the country, having previously purchased obsolete coal-fired power plants from NRG and Exelon. These are unique projects that require a special skill set in order to bring new economic development and jobs back to communities.”Source: Company Press Release",10 Jan 2019 ,PSEG divests two retired coal power plant sites to Hilco,Power,Fossil Fuel / Coal and Gas,Coal Plant,https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/Hudson_Generating_Station.jpg

"The growing impact of palm oil on deforestation has been well documented - and now its use in ""sustainable"" biofuel is being questioned by groups including Transport and Environment
Palm oil concession in Riau, Sumatra (Credit: Hayden/Wikimedia Commons)Biofuel is often put forward as a greener alternative to jet fuel in aviation – but one of its key producers has been criticised for relying on a bi-product of palm oil, a major contributor to deforestation.Finnish refining company Neste has set its ambitions on becoming the world’s largest aviation biofuel producer in 2019 – a move which has prompted a reaction from Biofuelwatch, which campaigns on the environmental and public health impacts of bioenergy.In its most recent  claims that despite Neste priding itself on sustainability, indirect impacts – which the campaigner says cause palm oil biofuels to have an estimated greenhouse gas footprint three-times as bad as the fossil fuels it replaces – “are ignored by Neste”.The report also states: “All of the palm mills from which Neste is sourcing are located in Sumatra, Borneo and the smaller Indonesian island of Belitung, in provinces which have seen – and continue to see – rampant deforestation linked to palm oil.”Neste currently claims to be the second most sustainable company in the world while Paul Paoletta, head of Neste Aviation Solutions, recently  to “produce more renewable jet fuel than all other providers combined”.However, it failed to mention the importance of palm oil in its biofuel product. Neste has rejected the claims it uses crude palm oil in its biofuel mix for jet fuel production.A spokesperson said: “Neste produced several tonnes of renewable jet fuel in 2018, and we are planning to increase production over the next few years to meet global market demand.“Our focus is on waste and residue raw materials. Waste and residue fats and oils account for nearly 80% of the renewable raw materials we use annually.“In addition to our focus on waste and residue oils and fats, sustainably produced 100% certified, and fully traceable palm oil accounts for approximately 20% of our renewable raw material usage.“However, as stated previously, we are not using palm oil in the renewable jet fuel production.”, it says it used 663,000 tonnes of palm oil in 2017 but classifies palm fatty acid distilate (PFAD) – a bi-product from the refinement of palm oil – as “wastes and residues”.It has not disclosed how much of its jet fuel uses PFAD.Because the use of PFAD drives up demand for the environmentally destructive crude palm oil, the . Neste’s plans to ramp up production in 2019 has raised concerns with Transport and Energy, a federation of NGOs campaigning for cleaner transport in Europe.Andrew Murphy, aviation manager for Transport and Environment, told Compelo: “Neste has some major plans to ramp up the use of palm oil in its biofuels and claim in some of its literature and communications that it’s going to be from sustainable sources.“But there is no way to ramp up palm oil consumption in this sort of manner in a way that’s sustainable.”
Mr Murphy cited the scale of Neste’s ambitions and its plans to expand operations in the aviation biofuel sector as the reason the company was singled out in the report.He added: “We are really keen to highlight the ongoing process in Europe to phase out the use of palm oil in the road transport sector.“This is just another example of where the aviation sector comes along and undermines the efforts that have been done in other areas through its environmentally damaging actions.“You see it with emission levels, which have increased in aviation while other sectors decrease, and you are now seeing the potential for palm oil consumption in the aviation sector to go up too.” The issue of palm oil deforestation hit the mainstream following the controversy over UK supermarket Iceland’s Christmas advert from the end of last year – which used snippets of a Greenpeace film.It was banned by ad clearance agency Clearcast for breaching political advertising rules.Palm oil is mostly produced in tropical climates and is found in products as diverse as food, cleaning products and biofuel.The high demand for the crop has led to massive deforestation in places such as Indonesia, where a  revealed palm oil traders had cleared an area of forest that was half the size of Paris.The  (IPCC) claims that tropical deforestation is responsible for 18% of greenhouse gas emissions, making it one of the biggest contributors to climate change.Issues over air quality and land usage rights, in areas cleared for palm oil production, are other major concerns.However, the charity  has warned a sustainable alternative to palm oil must be found before stopping the use of it altogether.It claims: “Because other oil crops – such as coconuts, olives, sunflowers and maize – are less productive per square kilometre, even more land would need to be converted to agriculture – causing even greater environmental damage.” Half of all palm oil used in Europe is found in biofuel to power diesel cars and trucks, .Transport and Environment recently launched the “No apes in my tank” campaign, which is lobbying the European Commission to stop recognising palm oil-derived fuel as a “green biodiesel” ahead of a vote on 1 February.The NGO’s  has received over 400,000 votes at the time of writing.Despite efforts to reduce its use in road transport, Mr Murphy fears this could be undermined by the surge in production of palm oil-derived biofuels in the aviation sector.He said: “There is a lot of focus at the moment about the use of palm oil in road transport and foods, but it’s a bit like whack-a-mole.“We prevent one driver of palm oil deforestation but while we’re doing that we allow the creation of a new one.”Some of the more sustainable options that Transport and Environment has highlighted include waste residue and used cooking oil – which would both have less of an impact on the climate than palm oil.Dutch airline  recycled from restaurants in Louisiana for its commercial flights in 2013.Electrofuels – which are a  – are another green alternative for airlines to consider.",10 Jan 2019 ,Campaigners call out use of palm oil in biofuel in bid to save the rainforest,Features & Analysis,Transportation & Logistics,Air,https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/Riau_palm_oil_2007.jpg

TenneT managing director Wilfried Breuer said: “With this, TenneT has now almost entirely achieved the federal government’s expansion goal of having 6,500 megawatts of offshore wind capacity by 2020. Already this year, TenneT will exceed this goal since the completion of BorWin3 in the course of 2019 will put a total of 7,132 megawatts of transmission capacity into operation in the North Sea alone.”By the end of 2023, another connection system will follow in the form of DolWin6, which will bring the available transmission capacity in the North Sea up to 8,032 MW.The wind energy transmitted from the North Sea by TenneT amounted to 16.75 terawatt hours (TWh)) in 2018 – a new record. This would be enough, for example, to cover the annual consumption of more than five million German households.The result in 2018 exceeded the previous year’s value (15.97 TWh) by 4.9 percent. Measured against the total wind output of Germany (106.45 TWh, offshore and onshore counted together)*), the North Sea wind contribution achieved a healthy share of 15.7 percent in 2017.Wilfried Breuer said: “It was foreseeable that the increase in the transmitted quantity of wind energy from sea to land in 2018 would be less pronounced than in previous years.“Making it all the more important to further accelerate the grid expansion on land in order to have the grid capacities on land needed to transport the electricity to the consumption-heavy regions of western and southern Germany as soon as possible.”In parallel with this, TenneT is developing and participating in numerous innovative approaches and projects involving smart future technologies, digitalization of the electricity grid, increasing of its flexibility and advancing the coupling of the different sectors.Breuer said: “We are aiming at planning security and greater cost efficiency.”One current innovative approach in the offshore area is the planned 66 kV technology that will be used for connecting the offshore wind farms to the future TenneT connections of DolWin5 and BorWin5. This technology can reduce investment cost and operational expenses by millions since the offshore transformer platforms of the wind farms are no longer needed and significantly less cable is required for connecting the individual wind turbine systems.Additional figuresThe current maximum infeed performance of offshore wind farms in the North Sea reached 4,773 MW on 15 December 2018. The capacity expansion for offshore wind farms in the North Sea was at 5,307 MW on 31 December 2018.The wind turbines in the Baltic Sea (not within the TenneT grid area) generated 2.35 terawatt hours) in 2018, which means Germany’s total offshore yield amounted to 19.1 terawatt hours).

The displays will receive input from NuScale’s Module Protection System and will not only enhance the already unparalleled safety of a NuScale Power Plant, but also continue to demonstrate the innovation NuScale brings to the industry.NuScale co-founder and chief technology officer José Reyes said: “NuScale’s plant design brings superior safety features that are revolutionizing nuclear safety, and we’re proud to pioneer the use of FPGA technology in a ground-breaking application for our safety display system.“We continue to make significant progress in the development of NuScale’s state-of-the-art digital instrumentation and control systems, as we build our systems from the ground up to meet technical, safety and regulatory criteria. Applying smarter, more efficient technology in this new context is not only great news for our company, but also for the US nuclear industry as a whole.”Building upon the development of the Module Protection System, the safety display and indication system is the next step in how NuScale is re-imagining nuclear instrumentation and control systems in partnership with Ultra’s Texas-based subsidiary team.The evolutionary digital display system has the capability to display safety-related reactor data in real-time, is configurable with multi-color, high-resolution graphics up to 1080p, and is able to graphically display historical data trends over a defined period of time. Use of FPGA technology also means a simpler, more efficient and predictable design: the safety display and indication system displays plant data without using microprocessors, operating systems, or software in the runtime environment.In addition, the innovative design has improved obsolescence tolerance and reduced cyber security attack vectors compared to other digital display systems currently available. Overall, the benefits have led to a more predictable and efficient safety justification process.Ultra strategy vice president Mark Ealing said: “These exceptional new safety displays show what is possible when two innovative companies come together and reimagine what the future of nuclear instrumentation and control systems can be. Ultra is proud to contribute to the success of America’s leading small modular reactor technology.”NuScale’s small modular reactor design has unparalleled safety and reliability performance, is factory-made, and offers scalable power based on need – an unprecedented capability in the nuclear energy industry. The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission is scheduled to complete NuScale’s Design Certification application review in September, next year.Source: Company Press Release",13 Jan 2019 ,"NuScale, Ultra Electronics Energy launch new digital display system to strengthen nuclear safety",Power,Nuclear,Technology and Scientific Breakthroughs,https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/nuscale.jpg

"British taxpayers have been subsidising UK wind farms since 2010, with last year seeing more than £100m go to energy operators in the country
The GMB says energy bill payers fronting up more than £100m to subsidise UK wind farms is a scandal that must come to an endBritain’s wind energy sector might be gaining momentum but taxpayers have been subsidising idle UK wind farms since 2010, fronting up more than £100m last year. have meant the state has been forced to make these “constraint payments” for energy firms to switch off their turbines and even discard their potential output.Justin Bowden, national secretary of energy workers’ trade union GMB, said last week: “It is the politicians who are responsible for this almost unbelievable waste of money.“It is a clear cut example of what happens when you separate the economic and political questions from the decision making,“Having made the political decision to increase renewable energy sources, the decisions on how to do this are made by technical bodies with no reference to the political issues involved.“One consequence of which is the electricity bill payers are fleeced.“This is then compounded by a failure to work through who pays for the connectivity while ensuring the economic benefits of who makes the equipment go into the UK economy.”Here we speak to experts about the problem, its implications for  and how it could potentially be solved. As it is an intermittent source of energy, wind power relies on the ambient wind speed at any given time, meaning there are periods where the generation is higher than the demand.During these periods, , and operators then need to be compensated for the loss in generation in order to keep them in business – this is what’s known as a constraint payment.This money is paid out by , which then adds the cost onto the bills paid by energy customers throughout Britain., the scale of constraint payments from the National Grid to wind power generators have grown exponentially since 2010.That year, taxpayers put forward £200,000 to subsidise idle windfarms, but by 2014 this number rose to £65m and last year it reached £109m.This steep rise is largely due to the increase in wind power capacity, however, which has grown from 5.5 gigawatts (GW) in 2010 to 23GW last year. The UK government’s Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) acknowledges the constraint payments’ existence, but is keen to reassure taxpayers that no “scandal” is in the works.It argues these payments don’t ultimately come at the cost of energy bill payers as they are made to ensure the long-term energy security and the best value for money for customers across the country.A spokesperson said: “It would be uneconomical for wind developers to build farms in locations with grid constraints, on the possibility of payments.“The payments they would receive to turn off their turbines would not provide a significant or stable revenue stream.“Onshore wind developers are unable to rely on constraint payments as a stable revenue stream over a long period.“For this reason, it is very unlikely that a developer would be incentivised to build a project on the possibility of payments from reducing their planned output.“Grid constraints are a natural part of operating an efficient electricity system, but the necessary grid infrastructure improvements are being made to ensure the UK’s homes can be powered by clean, green energy.” The UK’s energy regulator Ofgem argues the constraint payments are minor in comparison with the savings it has generated for energy customers.“We set the electricity system operator National Grid strong financial incentives to manage constraint costs efficiently,” a spokesperson said.“Overall, these costs are less than 1% of a typical household electricity bill. New capacity helps to reduce the level of constraint payments over time.“Our rules also prevent generators from charging excessively when they are asked to produce less power.”Ofgem’s price controls for energy network companies have delivered more than £5bn in savings for consumers since 2013.It is currently planning to implement a lower cost of capital (rate of return) for network companies in the next set of price controls from 2021 onwards, which the regulator claims will save consumers a further £6.5bn. While both Ofgem and BEIS have been deliberate in calming concerns over the idle wind farms subsidy issue, the fact remains large sums of money are essentially being wasted. argues there is a solution, however, and it involves increasing the capacity of the grid’s transmission network – the network through which electricity is allocated across the country.In theory, this should boost the amount of wind power it can absorb and remove the need for constraint payments altogether.“Especially important is the transmission network capacity between Scotland and England, since most of the constraints payment goes to wind power plants in Scotland,” he says.“The Western HVDC Link, a £1bn sub-sea transmission project, became ready to operate in October 2018, initially delivering up to 2250MW power transfer capability from Scotland to England and Wales.“Electricity had already been flowing in the link since December 2017, but further capacity has become available in 2018.”Mr Singh explains how as new transmission infrastructure is introduced, older coal-based power plants are decommissioned and , therefore reducing constraint payments.“Improvement in forecasting techniques, allowing reduction in mismatches between demand and supply will also help in reducing these costs,” he continues.“Interconnection capacity between different countries can also help absorb excess wind, or any variable renewable energy in fact, due to the different demand-supply characteristics in different countries.“So, rather than focusing on the amount of money being spent as constraint payments, it is important to focus on the ways of reducing the imbalance in the grid, through various means.“It’s also important to remember the UK needs wind power to fulfil its emissions reduction commitments.”",15 Jan 2019 ,Subsidising UK wind farms: Are British taxpayers being fleeced?,Wind,Offshore,Features & Analysis,https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/wind-farms-370x260.jpg
"Masdar, the Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company, and Taaleri Energia, a Finnish wind and solar developer and fund manager, signed an agreement for the establishment of a joint venture with the aim of developing renewable energy projects in Central and Eastern Europe.

Photo courtesy of Masdar.The joint venture aims to build upon the success of Masdar and Taaleri’s ongoing activities in the Western Balkans by expanding their collaboration through the joint development of onshore wind and solar photovoltaic (PV) projects.The joint venture agreement was signed by Karri Haaparinne, Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Taaleri Plc, and Bader Al Lamki, Executive Director of Clean Energy, Masdar, on the sidelines of the World Future Energy Summit (WFES), which is being organized as part of the Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week (ADSW) 2019 at the Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Center (ADNEC).Bader Al Lamki, Executive Director of Clean Energy, Masdar, said: “What we’ve accomplished in partnership with Taaleri in Serbia and Jordan is a testament to the important role that strong partnerships play in unlocking access to renewable energy. We are proud to build on the experiences gained through our strong collaboration, to help countries in Central and Eastern Europe meet their renewable energy goals.”Masdar and Taaleri have decided to jointly pursue the development of renewable energy projects in the Central and Eastern Europe region, due in part to the forecasted growth of renewable energy in the region and the substantial volume of opportunities. This includes the Polish onshore wind market, where more than 3 gigawatts of new capacity is expected to be added over the next few years. At the same time, multilateral institutions have recently urged the West Balkan countries to consider replacing a significant portion of their 9 gigawatts of aging coal-fired generation capacity with renewables, while Greece has announced plans to add up to 2.3 gigawatts of new solar and wind capacity by the end of 2020.Karri Haaparinne, Deputy CEO of Taaleri Plc, said: “We are pleased to build upon our successful experience of investing in Serbia alongside a highly-professional, world class partner such as Masdar.”Kai Rintala, Managing Director of Taaleri Energia, continued to articulate the underlying strategy for the venture by saying: “Working together with Masdar in this joint venture we will generate high quality deal flow in Central and Eastern Europe which will provide the funds that we manage opportunities to invest in the region in attractive projects with high calibre investment, financing, equipment and construction partners and counterparties.”The proposed joint venture between Masdar and Taaleri will further strengthen the companies’ strategic alliance in renewable energy. The Taaleri Energia SolarWind I fund has invested alongside Masdar in the Čibuk 1, 158 MW wind farm in Serbia, and in the Baynouna Solar Energy Company, which is constructing a 248 MWp solar PV plant in Jordan, the largest in the country.Masdar has steadily expanded its renewable energy portfolio in the Balkans through investments in large-scale onshore wind projects. In addition to the Čibuk 1 wind farm in Serbia, Masdar announced in 2018 that it had acquired a 49 per cent stake in the 72MW onshore Krnovo wind farm, which became Masdar’s second wind farm investment in the region.Source: Company Press Release",15 Jan 2019 ,Masdar and Taaleri to launch a JV for renewable energy development in Central and Eastern Europe,Power,Wind,Investment,https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/Masdar-Taaleri-JV-Signing.jpg
"Renewables are set to make up a larger proportion of the UK’s energy mix than fossil fuels as reliance on coal declines, says market analyst EnAppSys 
The SeaMade offshore wind farm will feature 58 wind turbines supplied by Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy (SGRE). Image courtesy of Eneco.Renewables will generate more than 50% of the UK’s energy mix by 2020 if current trends continue, according to a new report.Energy market analyst EnAppSys predicts clean energy will generate 121.3 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity compared with 105.6TWh from coal and gas-fired plants by next year.The new figures follow a recent study that revealed renewable energy sources made up one-third of Britain’s energy mix. , making up 33% of the UK’s energy production, while electricity generation fell to its lowest level since 1994.Coal and gas-fired power stations produced a combined 130.9TWh last year and  95.9TWh came from renewable sources.The amount generated by renewables saw an increase of 12.7TWh (or 15.2%) on 2017 – due in part to the success of wind power, which .Paul Verrill, director of EnAppSys, said: “Last year, levels of wind generation displaced conventional power stations and while this leaves room for baseload generation it does squeeze levels of output from other generators in the market.“In the short-term at least, wind will continue to be the primary source of renewable generation, having produced a record high share of the renewables mix (55.4%) in 2018.“With the moratorium on onshore wind and reductions in capital cost of offshore wind farms, it is likely that more of these offshore projects will come on stream in future years, which will drive even higher levels of renewable output.“New electrical transmissions infrastructure that came on line in 2018 will increase further the contribution of renewable energy to the UK fuel mix but constraints still persist despite the investments.”Looking to 2019, academics : “With more renewable capacity being installed, it is possible that solar could overtake coal, and renewables could generate more than nuclear for every single month.“They could also generate more than coal and gas combined over a month for the first ever time.“If any of these do happen, it will be yet another indication of the speed at which Britain’s electricity system is changing.” As levels of renewable generation have climbed, gas-fired output has remained relatively static, while levels of coal-fired generation have decreased by 89% since 2012.However, this change could put more pressure on supplying electrical power during peak demand, a situation which has been exacerbated by the suspension of capacity mechanism payments under an EU ruling in November 2018.The capacity market –  the main government policy for “keeping the lights on” – was used to ensure demand for electricity was met by supply by providing government payments for reliable energy source.The change comes at a time when the UK is becoming increasingly reliant on unpredictable wind generation.Mr Verrill said: “With conventional power stations still required to meet peak demand requirements, the suspension of the capacity mechanism payments that paid them to be available is a concern in terms of ensuring plants are incentivised to remain in the market.“Against this backdrop, the margins for thermal power generation fell to 2014 price levels as the impact of reduced demand, increased levels of wind generation and very competitive market dynamics placed downward pressure on profits.“This occurred despite overall market prices being 30% higher than in 2017, driven by higher gas prices and a recovery in the EU emissions trading system (ETS) carbon market.“This dynamic should settle down over time, but with rising competition in the market driven by the growth of renewables, it will become necessary to reinstate the capacity mechanism payments or some other alternative to fill the gap created by the lost income.“If this is not the case, it’s likely that plant closures will be necessary to remove oversupply from the system and this will lead to decreased security of supply.”",15 Jan 2019 ,Renewables set to become dominant force in Britain’s power mix by 2020,Wind,Power,Features & Analysis,https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/12/Image-1-SeaMade-Offshore-Wind-Farm.jpg

Photo: Courtesy of Petr Kovar/FreeImages.com.This go-live announcement follows a successful testing period where active power transfers have been taking place between Belgium and the UK.This interconnector is a major event for Elia and National Grid (UK). Not only is it the first interconnector with the UK, but also the first subsea interconnector and the first time the transmission system operator has employed HVDC (High-Voltage Direct Current) technology. HVDC is ideal for this kind of project because the two grids are not synchronized. It also controls flows better. This cable is the first of its kind in the world. Designed in Japan, it is unique due to the voltage involved (400 kV) and its use of XLPE (cross-linked polyethylene) as insulation material.Testphase successfully completedIn January 2019 the testing-phase was successfully ended. This was the final before the go-live. From 30 January Nemo Link will immediately enter service and play a role in integrating the European power grid. Elia and National Grid are making their infrastructure available to the market operators, i.e. the main players involved in exchanging electricity between Belgium and the UK. This will yield a better energy future for consumers in both countries while encouraging the transition to a sustainable and affordable system. Nemo Link is expected to see 1000 MW in electricity exchanges (equivalent to the capacity of a nuclear reactor), a significant plus in terms of ensuring security of supply.The culmination of 10 years of workNemo Link is a collaborative effort organised by Elia (Belgium) and National Grid (UK), which created a joint venture with a mixed Belgian-British team. The go-live of the Nemo Link interconnector marks the culmination of an enormous project that took nearly 10 years to complete. It never could have succeeded without the determined efforts of the men and women who worked together to complete the project.Source: Company Press Release",16 Jan 2019 ,Elia announces Nemo Link go-live date,Power,Transmission and Distribution,Power Cable,https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/electricity-1216395-640x480.jpg

Photo: Courtesy of rawpixel on Unsplash.Under the agreement, PC_Italia_02 paid €3.65 million (approximately $4.25 million) for certain assets, agreements and liabilities related to the ownership and operation of the three power plants. The three parks represent a total of 2.24MW of installed power located in the Budrio and Anagni regions of Italy.The new parks, which have been operating for nearly 5 years, bring approximately €600k (approximately $700k) additional annual revenues to ALTN with over 85% operating margins. The parks benefit from feed-in-tariff (FiT) government incentives that guaranty a fixed sales price for every megawatt of energy that the parks generate over twenty years from the date of construction. As a result, ALTN has a backlog of approximately €9.5 million (approximately $11 million at current exchange rates) of contracted revenues over the next 15 years. Thereafter the parks will continue to operate profitably and sell the energy generated to the national grid at the then market rates.Vincent Browne, CEO, President and Chairman of Alternus Energy commented, “It is personally very pleasing to finally complete this acquisition that we announced in late 2017. It emphasizes our continued commitment and growth in the Italian market going forward with additional strategic acquisitions in the pipeline there. These parks, coupled with our continuing expansion in Germany and in addition to our organic business, underpin our growing recurring annual revenues and income streams over the long term. We plan continued growth in the European market, organically as well as through strategic acquisitions of alternative energy assets and technology. These activities will continue to deliver accretive positive earnings and cashflows to ALTN which in turn will drive long term shareholder value.”In order to fund the acquisition and associated costs, ALTN, through its Netherlands Holding company, entered into the following agreements with a third party accredited investor. The Company issued a loan note in the aggregate principal amount of €3,849,333 (the “Note”) accruing interest at 12% per annum and having a six month term and upon other terms and subject to the limitations and conditions set forth in the Note. Commensurate with the Note issuance, the Company also entered i) a Security Agreement whereby the Company grants a security interest in all of the Company’s property, and ii) a Guaranty whereby the Company guarantees the payment of the Note issued by PC Europe.

Photo: courtesy of Business Wire.The microgrid, which incorporates solar photovoltaic panels, a natural gas reciprocating engine and an advanced battery storage system, was installed earlier this year and provides clean, resilient energy for a facility on the 200-acre Shell Technology Center Houston (STCH) campus. Home to nearly 2,000 Shell scientists, technologists and engineers, the STCH is the largest of the three Shell technology hubs; the others are in Amsterdam and Bangalore.Microgrids are integrated systems of multiple power generation sources and electric loads. When operated under a consolidated control with a sustainable energy management system, microgrid systems can produce and distribute electricity and operate independently from the larger power grid, increasing resilience and reliability.“By serving as a platform for hands-on research, the microgrid allows Shell to analyze different scenarios in renewable energy systems integration, providing an elevated level of technology assurance and insight,” said Dustin Rogge, Black & Veatch’s Project Manager. “By enabling the testing, demonstration and development of sustainable power solutions, the microgrid allows Shell to better understand complex distributed energy integration challenges. With this knowledge, Shell can accelerate its development and move solutions quickly to market.”“This project is an important step in Shell’s efforts to explore and develop new energy technologies as we work towards our goal to power progress together by providing more and cleaner energy solutions,” said Jon La Follett, Energy System Integration and Storage Program Lead in Shell’s New Energies Research and Technology Department. “Our New Energies business is working diligently to develop game-changing energy solutions, not just in urban areas like Houston, but in rural and remote areas around the world, from Asia to Africa.”Paired with the ASSET360 cloud-based data analytics platform, which is available through Black & Veatch’s software subsidiary Atonix Digital, the microgrid raises STCH’s resilience and reliability by providing critical services during a power outage or other service anomaly. Designed to provide actionable insights about the microgrid’s performance, ASSET360 allows Shell operators to optimize operation based on energy demand, solar production and other conditions.“The microgrid is already generating value for STCH by providing resilient, renewable power for part of our campus,” La Follett said. “And by exporting power to the local grid, we are generating economic benefit.”“But more importantly, this environment gives us the opportunity to test different ideas and strategies as we work to understand the operational envelope of these different components. One of the things that makes this microgrid unique is the diversity of the components that are involved. We wanted the flexibility to test numerous combinations of distributed energy resources.”The system combines 300 kilowatts (kW) of ground-mounted solar, a 127-kW natural gas generator, a 250-kW, 1,050-megawatt-hour (MWh) lithium ion battery and a 250-kW load bank.

"VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland has developed a new technique based on gasification, which offers a sustainable way to turn forest industry byproducts, such as bark, sawdust and forestry waste, into transport fuels and chemicals. 
Image: The development of gasification technology takes place in VTT’s Bioruukki piloting centre in Espoo, Finland. Photo: Courtesy of Kuvalähde/VTT.The new technique reduces carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 90% compared to fossil fuels.The new approach uses gasification to turn biomass into intermediate products – liquid hydrocarbons, methanol or methane – in production units integrated with communal district heating plants or forest industry power plants. The intermediate products are processed further in oil refineries to make renewable fuels or chemicals.VTT developed and piloted the new gasification process and evaluated the competitiveness of plants based on the technique in the course of a recently concluded project called BTL2030. The distributed generation process developed by the project team makes efficient use of the energy content of biomass. Approximately 55% of the energy content is turned into transport fuels and a further 20–25% can be used to provide district heating or to produce steam for industrial processes. The new technique reduces carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 90% compared to fossil fuels.Sustainable bioenergy plays an important role in the fight against climate changeAccording to the International Energy Agency (IEA), modern bioenergy plays a key role in building a cleaner and more sustainable energy system. Bioenergy currently accounts for approximately 50% of the world’s renewable energy consumption, and the IEA estimates that bioenergy will be the most rapidly growing form of renewable energy between 2018 and 2023. In the longer term, limiting global warming to two degrees requires, according to the IEA, almost quadrupling bioenergy’s contribution to the world’s energy consumption, from the current 4.5% to approximately 17% by 2060.Bioenergy is needed, in particular, for reducing emissions from air transport and shipping and as a back-up fuel for road transport as more electric cars are introduced. The use of forest industry by-products, such as bark, forestry waste, recycled wood, straw or other biomass as raw materials does not impact on the carbon sink effect of forests, and they do not compete against forest industry raw material procurement or food production.By-products to provide heat throughout the yearThe process is based on VTT’s low-pressure, low-temperature steam gasification technology, simplified gas purification and small-scale industrial syntheses. Thanks to the small-scale approach, the heat generated by the process can be used throughout the year, and the process can be fuelled with local waste. Finland’s previous plans have involved considerably larger gasification-based diesel plants, the raw material demands of which could not have been satisfied with locally sourced waste. Moreover, it would have been impossible to make full use of the by-productheat of the large plants, and their energy efficiency would have therefore been easily less than 60%.Considerable improvements expected in the competitiveness of plants“Not one of the large gasification plants of more than 300 MW that have been planned for Europe has been built yet. The almost EUR 1 billion investment needed together with the risks associated with new technology has proven an insurmountable obstacle. The smaller scale of our solution makes it easier to secure funding for building the first plant based on the new technology”, explains VTT’s Senior Principal Scientist Esa Kurkela.The BTL2030 project team estimates that the production costs of transport fuels made from domestic waste would amount to EUR 0.8–1 per litre of petrol or diesel. The new technology is set to become considerably more competitive as the costs of the raw materials of competing technologies increase, and the process is expected to be highly competitive at least from the year 2030 onwards. The project involved mapping out the path from pilot-scale development to demonstrations and commercialising the technology with participating businesses. Even in the short term, the ultimate competitiveness of the new technique hinges on the prices of crude oil and carbon dioxide quotas as well as the taxation of renewable transport fuels.Gasification technology projected to have huge export potentialExperts estimate that, in addition to other measures, Finland will need sustainable biofuels to account for 30% of the energy consumption of the transport sector by 2030. Supplying half of this demand with domestic waste would require 5–10 locally integrated energy production plants. The 3.6% target set for advanced biofuels in the European Commission’s Renewable Energy Directive (RED2) equates to 11 million tonnes of oil, which would mean approximately 200 gasification plants in Europe alone.In addition to transport fuels, the biomass gasification technique can be used to produce renewable raw materials to replace oil and natural gas in various chemical industry processes. Synthesis gas applications, on the other hand, could help in the attainment of several circular economy goals, such as close-loop recycling of plastics and other packaging materials.Research and development work to continue through EU projectsThe development of gasification technology is set to continue through two EU Horizon 2020 projects coordinated by VTT. The projects focus on gas purification and increasing the efficiency of synthesis technology and aim to demonstrate the performance of the entire biofuel chain at VTT’s Bioruukki piloting centre in Espoo, Finland. Another solution under development is a flexible hybrid process based on biomass and solar and wind energy, which can either be run on just biomass or be boosted with electrolysis. This provides an efficient way to store solar or wind energy as a renewable fuel and could as much as double the renewable fuel output of the biomass sources available.Source: Company Press Release",17 Jan 2019 ,VTT develops a new sustainable way to turn forestry waste into transport fuels and chemicals,Power,Bioenergy,Technology,https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/EPR3.jpg
"Florida Power & Light Company (FPL), already a leader in solar energy, today announced a groundbreaking ""30-by-30"" plan to install more than 30 million solar panels by 2030 and make the state of Florida a world leader in the production of solar energy.
Image: FPL announces '30-by-30' plan. Photo: Courtesy of Samuel Zeller/Unsplash.FPL has secured solar sites throughout the state, which will enable the company to continue to cost effectively build solar energy centers across Florida. This bold plan will capture economies of scale and promote the construction of efficient and cost-effective solar generation. The end result will be the largest installation of solar panels by a regulated utility in the world and a 67 percent fleet-wide reduction in carbon dioxide (CO) emissions rate by 2030 as compared to the national average.FPL and its sister company, NextEra Energy Resources, are already the world’s largest producer of renewable energy from the wind and sun and, when this plan is completed, FPL expects to be the largest utility owner and operator of solar in America. Having advanced clean energy affordably for many years, including embarking upon one of the largest solar expansions in the country over the past two years, FPL also will be making unprecedented investments in advanced and innovative battery storage technology that will extend the use of clean, affordable solar energy even after the sun has gone down.“FPL is not your traditional electric company,” said Eric Silagy, president and CEO of FPL. “We’re a technology company that delivers power, and we’ve long believed in making smart, forward-thinking infrastructure investments to produce tangible, long-term benefits – cleaner air, lower electric rates and reliable service – for our customers and our state. Now we’re taking our long-standing clean energy commitment to the next level. Bottom line, this bold, innovative plan is the right thing to do for our customers and for our fast-growing state, and we look forward to working with local and state officials and our regulators to make this vision a reality.”“I am supportive of programs that will provide Floridians with greater access to affordable, clean energy which will help propel the State to a healthier future,” said Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.  “We live in the Sunshine State and solar energy is a natural resource that should be seriously considered. FPL’s initiative is important. As Florida’s energy needs continue to grow at a rapid pace, it is important that we diversify our energy resources. This is vital to the economic well-being of our State and quality of life for residents.”“FPL’s ’30-by-30′ plan is a monumental commitment to the State of Florida, our clean energy progress and the economic well-being of our cities, counties and all Florida workers and residents,” said state Senator Bill Montford (D), Chairman of the Environment and Natural Resources Committee.“The best part about this announcement is that we know we can trust FPL to deliver on its promise because the company has a history of overachieving when it says it will modernize Florida’s clean energy mix,” said state Senator Wilton Simpson (R), Chairman of the Innovation, Industry and Technology Committee.FPL already has begun pairing battery storage technology at its solar power plants. Future technology is planned to increase the capacity and cost-effectiveness of batteries, making them a vital part of FPL’s future. As a result, the company projects to deploy a significant amount of battery storage throughout Florida by 2030.FPL’s planned renewable energy generation and storage, combined with its nuclear power plants in St. Lucie and Miami-Dade counties, is projected to generate more than 40 percent of its electricity emissions-free by 2030, even as the state’s population – the third highest in the nation – continues to grow. In fact, the company’s 2030 CO emissions rate target represents a 67 percent reduction versus the 2005 U.S. electric industry average.“FPL and NextEra Energy Resources have been at the forefront of advancing affordable clean energy for decades,” Silagy said. “It’s why our customers enjoy electricity that is among the cleanest and most reliable in the country for a price more than 30 percent below the national average. That said, we’re not satisfied with the status quo and understand that our customers expect even more from us as energy experts and industry leaders. It’s why we’re reimagining the way we serve our customers and challenging ourselves to find even more innovative ways to do what’s best for Florida and the nation.”Advancing solar energy affordably and responsiblyBy far the state’s largest producer of solar energy, FPL has studied solar technology for decades and, today, operates 18 large solar power plants and hundreds of other universal solar installations across Florida. In 1984, FPL commissioned its first universal solar installation, a 10-kilowatt photovoltaic facility in Miami that helped the company’s employees gain experience with the then-emerging technology. Over the years, FPL has continued to test and operate a wide variety of solar technologies. In 2009, FPL became the first company to build large universal scale solar projects in Florida and, in 2016, was the first to leverage its purchasing power to build three 74.5-megawatt solar power plants, which are producing net savings for FPL customers.Continuing to invest in emerging and innovative technologies for FloridaFor several years, FPL and its sister companies have researched battery storage technology to study a variety of potential benefits, from grid stabilization to improved solar integration. In 2018, FPL unveiled the largest combined operating solar and storage power plant at Babcock Ranch in Charlotte County, uniquely advantageous because of the ability to harness extra energy produced at solar power plants when the sun’s rays are strongest. The additional solar energy and the increased predictability afforded by battery storage can enable FPL to more efficiently dispatch other power plants, helping save customers on fuel costs while reducing emissions.Optimizing nuclear power plants to generate even more 24/7, emissions-free energyFPL’s four nuclear units in St. Lucie and Miami-Dade counties have long generated zero-emissions energy 24/7 for customers and are essential to preserve clean air and address climate change. In recent years, FPL has invested more than $3 billion to upgrade its Turkey Point and St. Lucie nuclear units, adding more than 500 megawatts of new carbon-free capacity, which is the equivalent of adding more than two million solar panels.Modernizing power plant fleet and shutting down coalFPL plans to continue increasing the fuel efficiency of its highly efficient fleet of natural gas power plants. Since 2001, the company’s program to phase out older, oil-fired power plants and replace them with highly efficient clean energy centers has reduced the company’s reliance on foreign oil more than 99 percent, saved FPL customers more than $9.5 billion in fuel costs and prevented 120 million tons of carbon emissions from being produced. The FPL Okeechobee Clean Energy Center – which will run on U.S.-produced natural gas – is set to be the cleanest, most fuel-efficient power plant of its kind in the world when it comes online later this year, only to be topped in efficiency by the FPL Dania Beach Clean Energy Center when it begins generating electricity in 2022.FPL is also poised to eliminate its only remaining coal plant in Florida by the end of this year. The company shut down two coal plants in Jacksonville in 2016 and 2018, respectively, collectively preventing nearly seven million tons of carbon emissions annually.Source: Company Press Release",17 Jan 2019 ,FPL announces ’30-by-30′ plan to install more than 30 million solar panels by 2030,Power,Solar,PV,https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/EPR2.jpg

"Hitachi has suspended its work on the Wylfa Newydd nuclear power station project just two months after Toshiba pulled the plug on its Moorside nuclear scheme
Artist's impression of the planned Wylfa Newydd nuclear power station, in Anglesey, WalesCalls have been made for the UK government to step in and save the planned Wylfa Newydd nuclear power station after the project leader pulled the plug.The GMB trade union for energy workers warned of a “looming energy crisis” after Japanese engineering giant Hitachi suspended work on the £20bn plant in Anglesey, north Wales – putting thousands of jobs at risk.The Nuclear Industry Association urged the government to work with industry to deliver “urgent” new capacity.Hitachi’s UK subsidiary Horizon Nuclear Power said it had been unable to agree with the government on a financing model – but refused to rule out revisiting the project in the future.Its announcement today (17 January)  GMB national secretary for energy Justin Bowden pointed out the pressing need for new nuclear sites to be commissioned as all but one of the UK’s nuclear capacity to come offline by 2030.“Hitachi’s announcement, coming so soon after the , raises the very real prospect of a UK energy crisis,” he said.“ and the existing nuclear fleet reaches the end of its natural life after 50 years, decisions are already long overdue for construction to be completed in time and not leave the country at risk of power cuts or reliant on imported electricity, much of it from unreliable regimes.“While the government has had its head up its proverbial backside over Brexit, vital matters like guaranteeing the country’s future energy supply appear to have gone by the wayside.“The go-ahead on a new, part publicly-funded power station at Wylfa, and the accompanying creation of thousands of new jobs and apprenticeships, was an unusual outbreak of common sense in UK energy policy.“GMB had hoped it signalled a new dawn for the country’s vital infrastructure by providing surety and pushing down the costs to taxpayers and electricity bill payers.”  – enough to power five million homes.Construction was due to start next year, with the project tipped to generate 9,000 jobs during the development process and 850 permanent roles once its 60-year operation life cycle begun.The reactors would be similar to those used in the Somerset-based , which .Mr Bowden claimed the Hitachi decision “has nothing to do with costs” as the Wylfa Newydd nuclear power station could be made cheaper than the Hinkley development due to the existing design brief and government stake in the project – which involved underwriting billions of pounds in loans.“The government must act and step in now, pick up the reins and take whatever funding stake and leadership is necessary to ensure Wylfa goes ahead on time,” he added.“The NDA (Nuclear Decommissioning Authority) has the nuclear expertise and could be immediately redesignated to do this.“At the end of the day, it is a basic function of the government to guarantee we have enough electricity for our homes and industries, and history shows that voters do not forgive or forget when the lights go out.“New nuclear is almost zero-carbon and because it produces energy 24/7, it is a perfect complement to wind and solar – which everyone knows don’t work all the time.“Once again, this tragic farce shows it is foolish to rely on foreign companies and foreign governments to keep Britain’s lights on and our economy powered when we could do easily be fully energy self-sufficient.” , chief executive of the UK’s Nuclear Industry Association, called the news “disappointing” for the entire nuclear industry.He said: “Wylfa remains a strong site for vital new nuclear power for the UK.“It’s regrettable that this project has been suspended, especially as a considerable amount of groundwork has already taken place on the Wylfa project, including creating a supply chain to deliver the project.“Nuclear at Wylfa has local support, and the Horizon project would provide 60 years of reliable, secure, low-carbon power for homes, businesses and public services – with a strike price much below any offshore wind project generating power now and cost-competitive with all low-carbon generation.“It is imperative that new nuclear at this site goes ahead and the barriers to that are removed.”He claimed Wylfa Newydd is a key part of the country’s nuclear building programme, saying “the urgent need for further new nuclear capacity in the UK should not be underestimated”.Nuclear power provides 21% of the UK’s electricity mix and 40% of the country’s low-carbon generation.Mr Greatrex added: “If we want a balanced generation mix, government must work with industry to deliver that vital capacity on this site.“Without a diverse low carbon mix and with increasing demand to power electric vehicles, we run the risk of becoming more reliant on burning fossil fuels to produce our electricity.” Business Secretary Greg Clark told Parliament in June that a key focus of the government’s discussions with Hitachi had been about driving down costs and maximising value for consumers and taxpayers.The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said it will continue to engage with the company about Wylfa Newydd’s future, while it is also exploring the viability of adopting the regulated asset base (RAB) funding model for future projects.This would transfer risk from developers to consumers, but is designed to bring more investors to the table.A BEIS spokeswoman said: “As the Business Secretary set out in June, any deal needs to represent value for money and be the right one for UK consumers and taxpayers.“Despite extensive negotiations and hard work by all sides, the government and Hitachi are unable to reach agreement to proceed at this stage.“This government is committed to the nuclear sector, giving the go-ahead to the first new nuclear power station in a generation at Hinkley Point C, investing £200m through our recent sector deal – which includes millions for advanced nuclear technologies.“We are also reviewing alternative funding models for future nuclear projects and will update on these findings in summer 2019.”  Hitachi’s  confirmed mounting speculation that the parent company’s board would suspend work on its UK nuclear programme.As well as Wylfa Newydd, this also included a site at Oldbury-on-Severn, in South Gloucestershire, where plans were bring drawn up to generate at least 2,900MW.Horizon Nuclear Power CEO Duncan Hawthorne said: “We have made very strong progress on all aspects of the project’s development, including the UK design of our tried and tested reactor, supply chain development and especially the building of a very capable organisation of talented and committed people.“We have been in close discussions with the UK government, in co-operation with the government of Japan, on the financing and associated commercial arrangements for our project for some years now.“I am very sorry to say that despite the best efforts of everyone involved we’ve not been able to reach an agreement to the satisfaction of all concerned.“As a result, we will be suspending the development of the Wylfa Newydd project, as well as work related to Oldbury, until a solution can be found.“In the meantime, we will take steps to reduce our presence but keep the option to resume development in future.”Mr Hawthorne said the company would begin consultation with staff about what the decision means for their jobs.He reiterated the “critical” role nuclear can play in generating secure, low-carbon and affordable energy in Britain.Mr Hawthorne added: “Wylfa Newydd in Anglesey remains the best site for nuclear development in the UK and we remain committed to keeping channels of communication open with the government and our other key stakeholders regarding future options at both our sites.”",17 Jan 2019 ,Wylfa Newydd nuclear power station becomes second UK project to be suspended – so what next?,Features &

"The NorthConnect is a proposed 415-mile energy cable between the UK and Norway and will be pivotal in Britain's efforts to move towards renewable energy
The 415-mile subsea interconnector between Scotland and Norway is due for approval todayWhen it comes to embracing renewable energy, many countries could learn a lot from Norway and Scotland – which will soon exchange green electricity in the NorthConnect project.The 415-mile energy cable between the two countries was approved by the Aberdeenshire Council today (17 January) and construction is due to start in 2023.The £1.75bn project will link  with Samnanger in the south west of Norway via a 1,400 megawatt (MW) “interconnector” .NorthConnect UK permitting manager Richard Blanchfield said today: “I am delighted that the North Connect project has passed another significant milestone on its journey to becoming a reality.“The cables will be able to transport energy in both directions, monitor and respond instantaneously to meet the demands of either energy market and, crucially, be able to be called upon in the event of a ‘black start’ situation [a power outage], ensuring our lights stay on.“NorthConnect is looking towards operation in 2023/24 and now the only piece of the UK planning and licencing jigsaw left is the marine licence, on which we expect a decision on in the coming months.” The NorthConnect project is being led by a Norwegian company of the same name, along with development firms SSE Interconnector Limited, Vattenfall UK, Agder Energi, E-CO and Lyse.The proposal for the project was originally approved by UK regulator Ofgem in June 2016.It comprises the following main components:It will be capable of transmitting high-voltage electricity back and forth between the two countries, with a converter station on a site at Fourfields, north of London, having been built in 2015.The construction phase will reportedly create up to 600 jobs, with more than 300 of those lasting over a year and a half.NorthConnect has undertaken a marine survey to refine the subsea cable route corridor from Peterhead to Norway.Aberdeenshire Council’s infrastructure chief Stephen Archer said: “The proposed cable will allow energy to be shared, meaning hydro power from Norway can be transferred to Scotland when local renewable sources such as wind power cannot meet demand, and vice-versa for periods where Norwegian sources are struggling.“This ensures security of supply whilst using renewable sources, which helps meet the aims and targets.” The news of the gargantuan interconnector comes as the UK’s ambassador to Norway Richard Wood expressed his country’s intention to work with Norway towards a future where renewable energy is prominent in the UK.He argues the focal point of this working relationship should be gas, which accounted for 47% of UK supply in 2017 and was largely imported from Norwegian companies.“Norway already plays a pivotal role in Europe’s gas supply security – meeting around 20% of all of Europe’s demand, and will continue to do so in the future as we require more imported gas,” he said at the Diplomatic Gas Forum on Monday.“We are already seeing the growth of the European gas pipeline network underway, solid plans for new routes as well as bringing new supply from harder to reach areas.“Expansion further north is bringing new supplies that the UK sees as positive for energy security and long-term gas supply to the British market – and growing our energy partnership with Norway.“More broadly, we have shared interests in the North Sea – underpinned by our established bilateral agreements.“Norway is a valued investor in UK wind projects and we are looking forward to the completion of the interconnector, which we believe will benefit both Norway and the UK.”Norway is reported to generate 98% of its electricity from renewables, with hydropower making up the bulk.  The NorthConnect cable and the partnership with Norway proposed by Mr Wood are both part of .This is intended to act as a blueprint to cut carbon emissions, protect the environment, meet domestic and international climate change obligations, and drive economic growth.The UK has cut more than 40% of its emissions since 1990, while also growing the economy by more than two thirds – a trend the government claims is due to the shift from coal to gas and renewables.“We are committed to clean, smart, flexible power – Investing in renewables such as offshore wind,” add Mr Wood.“This is an area where the UK and Norway already have a strong partnership with significant Norwegian investment in the UK.”",17 Jan 2019 ,What is NorthConnect?

"Mitsubishi Electric Corporation (TOKYO: 6503) announced today that it has developed two technologies for gas-insulated switchgears: an arc-cooling technology that achieves a 25 percent improvement in the interruption of electrical current in sulfur-fluoride (SF6) gas-insulated switchgears used in high-voltage power systems, and a high-density dielectric coating technology that improves insulation performance by 30 percent in high-voltage conductors. 
Image: Mitsubishi Electric develops new gas-insulated switchgear technologies for electric power applications. Photo: courtesy of Mitsubishi Electric Corporation.The two technologies will contribute to the further miniaturization of switchgears and help to reduce the use of SF6 gas, which has global-warming potential that is 22,800 times greater than that of CO2.Key Features
1)
Arc-cooling technology for interrupter improves current-interruption performance by 25 percent
–
High-pressure gas generated with a unique coolant effectively cools and then extinguishes the conductive arc (conductive plasma) during current interruption.
–
Current flow through the arc is reduced by the arc’s change into insulated gas, thereby improving current interruption by 25 percent compared to conventional non-coolant method.Details:The interrupter has two pairs of electrodes that remain closed when electric power is supplied. When the electrodes are opened the current cannot be interrupted immediately due to the conductive arc. In conventional method, the arc is extinguished by flowing the arc with gas to lower its temperature. Mitsubishi Electric’s new arc-cooling technology uses a unique coolant to generate a high-pressure gas jet to effectively cool and then extinguish the arc.The high-density dielectric coating technology densifies the dielectric coating layer on high-voltage conductors and thereby improves dielectric performance by 30 percent compared to operation without this dielectric coating layer.In the switchgear, compressed SF6 gas is injected between a metal high-voltage conductor and a grounded tank. If the conductor’s metal surfaces are not coated, surface roughness of even just several μm can lead to electric discharges and thereby diminish the dielectric performance of the SF6 gas. Mitsubishi Electric’s new dielectric coating technology inhibits such discharges for improved dielectric performance. In addition, densifying the dielectric coating layer suppresses discharges due to air in the dielectric coating layer.Improved current interruption achieved with the new arc-cooling technology enables the number of interrupters to be reduced from two to one.
–
The new high-density dielectric coating technology suppresses discharges from the conductor surfaces, making it possible to reduce the size of the SF6 gas tank.Details:A gas-insulated switchgear incorporates an SF6 gas tank, which also contains an interrupter and high-voltage conductor. Conventional designs required two interrupters to conform to Japan’s JEC-2300 standard and the IEC 62271-100 international standard. However, Mitsubishi Electric’s new gas-insulated switchgear requires only one interrupter thanks to the new arc-cooling technology for improved current-interruption performance. In addition, incorporation of a dense coating layer in the high-voltage conductor improves dielectric performance and thereby allows the distance between the conductor and the grounded enclosure to be shortened, which enables a smaller enclosure to be used. As a result, reducing the number of interrupters and tank size enables less SF6 gas to be used.Source: Company Press Release",18 Jan 2019 ,Mitsubishi Electric develops new gas-insulated switchgear technologies for electric power applications,Power,Transmission and Distribution,Switchgear,https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/0117-a.jpg

Photo: Courtesy of Ørsted A/S.This first-of-its-kind partnership will create an unprecedented opportunity for commercial fishermen to provide direct input to the wind energy industry on matters of significant interest to their businesses. Under this partnership, both industries will remain autonomous but provide a platform to move towards workable solutions. While non-binding in nature, it is RODA and Ørsted’s hope that discussions will prove beneficial to all parties involved.“Partnering with Ørsted is a significant step forward as we look to strengthen our ongoing dialogue between commercial fishermen and offshore wind developers,” said RODA Executive Director Annie Hawkins. “RODA believes that we need to develop solutions for offshore wind energy and commercial fishing to coexist, and today’s announcement will support future sustainability for both industries.”“We are proud to be the first offshore wind developer to partner with RODA, which is an important part to the future of offshore wind,” said CEO of Ørsted U.S. Offshore Wind and President of Ørsted North America Thomas Brostrøm. “The fishing community must be considered as offshore wind development continues in the U.S. Through this partnership, we will be able to share our concerns in a productive way and develop practical solutions as we all seek to coexist and thrive for a better tomorrow.”RODA is the only national commercial fishing organization that is purpose-built for interacting with the offshore wind industry to maintain sustainable fisheries. Based from Midcoast Maine to the Outer Banks of North Carolina, it also has the broadest geographic and gear-type range of any East Coast fishing industry membership organization active in offshore wind engagement.The RODA Board of Directors consists of fishing industry representatives who bring over 200 years of combined operational and management experience, split across the range of federally and state-managed Atlantic fisheries. One of RODA’s primary goals is to ensure that the fishing industry’s input at-large is received, considered, and accommodated to the maximum extent possible in leasing, design, construction, and operations of new offshore developments.“It is extremely vital that our nation’s fishermen are heard when offshore wind projects are being developed,” said RODA Chairman and Director of Sustainability at Atlantic Capes Fisheries Peter Hughes. “Ørsted has made it clear that they want to be partners with the fishing industry, and we are optimistic that our work with them will set a standard ensuring that fishermen have direct input into wind farm designs and ensuring that their concerns are fully embraced by developers.”A core component of the partnership will be the creation of a joint industry task force to explore improved approaches to project siting, design, and operations. The two industries have already engaged in extensive communication regarding topics ranging from navigation concerns (including transit lanes and turbine layouts) and other impacts avoidance to identifying a mutual interest in developing transparent strategies for long-term mitigation. This new initiative will provide a more structured process for further collaboration between the two industries.Ørsted and RODA strongly encourage other offshore wind energy developers and commercial fishermen to join this partnership in order to develop well-informed and enduring approaches to best practices and provide broad representation of the industries.Source: Company Press Releases",18 Jan 2019 ,RODA and Ørsted partner to address fisheries and offshore wind coexistence,Power,Wind,Offshore,https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/EPR1-1.jpg
