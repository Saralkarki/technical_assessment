"French consultancy Capgemini's latest report has found automation is vastly under-estimated by energy companies around the world
Automation began entering the oil and gas industry in the 1990sDespite 81% of all energy companies reporting positive results from the use of automation, just 15% have actually used it in their business, according to a new study.The report by , which surveyed 529 global energy firms and utilities, found almost half under-estimated the benefits of the technology.Just a little over 20% in the US have introduced intelligent automation initiatives, however, compared with 16% in France and India, and just 8% in the UK.Meanwhile, it showed just 20% of oil and gas firms around the world are using automation at scale, while just 6% of water companies are doing the same.The report read: “, deregulation and decentralisation are having a significant impact.“Currently only 10% of UK’s electricity comes from coal-fired generators, and in 2019
the National Grid has logged more than 1,000 hours of coal-free electricity.“The sector is moving from its conservative, regulated past to a new future where innovation is key.“Its consumer base, which used to be largely passive, has now moved to a world of
‘prosumers’ who expect a sophisticated, service-based industry – digitalisation will be critical to capitalising on these shifts.“Technologies, such as automation and AI, are playing a pivotal role in managing the balance between demand and supply, boosting efficiencies in all the entirety of the value chain, innovating the customer experience and transforming business models.”In terms of boosting operations, topline growth and engaging customers, Capgemini’s report suggests  for the energy companies around the world that have already implemented it into their business models.It highlighted that utilities, specifically, recorded higher value from the technology than the average of respondents from all industries, with 40% of executives in the sector reporting an increase in operations quality, as opposed to 30% across all businesses.Meanwhile, 45% had seen a rise in inbound customer leads (27% for all sectors), 81% had had improved the customer experience through faster responses (60% for all sectors) and 32% had seen an increased in staff productivity (26% for all sectors).The numbers showcased in its report have led Capgemini to estimate the energy sector can save between $237bn (£188bn) to $813bn (£646bn) from introducing intelligent automation at scale.Abhijeet Bhandare, chief automation officer at US conglomerate General Electric’s power division, said: “We have a very clear filtering criteria defined for automation use cases.“We have close to 200 automation ideas in the pipeline, and on average about 50% to 60% of them will be rejected.“It is important to focus your attention on the remaining 50%, as they will give you the most value.“And you must have the right criteria – whether it is value, efficiencies, cost savings or the opportunity cost.“Organisations should focus on quality over quantity of use cases.”",13 Jun 2019 ,"Just 20% of energy companies are using ‘under-estimated’ automation, finds study",

"Here Matthew Walters, head of consultancy and customer data services at LeasePlan UK, shares his thoughts on the future of electric vehicles in the UK
(Credit: Tesla)Last year, the government announced that it would ban the sale of traditionally fuelled vehicles by 2040, after pressure from the EU and environmental groups to ensure a more environmentally-friendly Britain.However, despite positive reinforcement from the government and numerous studies showing , there is still nationwide doubt about the potential of an electric future.So, what is causing the UK’s electric future to remain grid-locked?Here, I outline the biggest barriers facing the industry today which need addressing to help drive the electric revolution forward.Recent  have shown that a major concern is the limited amount of public charging points available for EVs.This isn’t an unfounded fear. Currently, the UK’s average ratio of charge points to EVs is 43-to-one.Our  revealed that the UK is now lagging behind our European neighbours in its electric vehicle preparation.Our annual EV Readiness Index showed that despite the UK currently holding the third position for the number of EVs registered, the UK only has 0.27 charging plugs per 1,000 inhabitants.In comparison,  has a ratio of 4.8 charging plugs per 1,000 inhabitants, followed closely by Norway with 4.5.Whilst the anxiety will certainly be reduced as newer EVs increase to 250 miles and beyond, even if this becomes the norm, there is still concern over the range these vehicles can realistically offer.This will certainly be a source of apprehension for businesses that operate a multi-vehicle fleet and often travel long distances.Whilst you can plan a route, accounting for charging points along the way, congestion and traffic delays or diversions cannot always be foreseen.Ensuring the reliability of information on whether a charge point is in use is also something the industry and drivers will need to consider.The good news is that the government is encouraging the progression of charging infrastructure, with the announcement of a .This fund also aims to ensure there are enough public facilities, a standardised way to pay and that each charge point is compatible with all available models.This should be seen as an ambitious starting point though, rather than an all-encompassing solution.Hopefully, the government’s new investment will address the above concerns.However, even if there are sufficient charging points available, will the grid be able to support the EV framework, and how will this work? Whilst the National Grid claims that it already has the necessary power to charge the  EVs predicted to be in operation by 2040, it has acknowledged that it will lack the ability to charge all EVs simultaneously.This highlights an obvious issue; many drivers will want to charge their cars at the same time, either during work or in the evening.If there is not enough energy to meet this demand, it could lead to large areas being put at risk of power black-outs.Consequently, entire counties might wake up to find they have no electricity and their car won’t start.To add to this, only , meaning some businesses may be put under pressure to provide their employees with charging facilities at work.Right now, the National Grid predicts that we will depend upon a mix of smart meters and V2G (Vehicle to Grid) technology to ensure demand does not outweigh supply.In an ideal world, vehicles that plug in wouldn’t charge until off-peak hours, but instead act as a giant battery back up to the grid for peak hours when most households are maximising their energy consumption.Whilst this is certainly not a pipe dream with several successful trials underway, this would require extensive change of the current home charge network to ensure V2G and more rapid charge capabilities, as well as a new Feed In Tariff similar to . According to our own , the UK is the fifth most cost-effective place in Europe to own an EV – behind Hungary, Poland, Norway and the Netherlands.However, policymakers should not be complacent. The whole life cost for an electric vehicle still must improve significantly.List prices remain high and the second hand market is still not mature, so the cost for a broadly similar petrol equivalent is still the most economic choice in most instances.We should also keep a cautious eye on any changes to vehicle taxation which are expected to be announced in the coming months, as well as any further reduction in the EV grant structure.The government must maintain the 2% tax band, low Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) and current EV grant levels if their numbers are to continue to increase.We must also give thought to what will be introduced to plug the gap in the treasury’s finances  and fuel duty income reduces with road user pricing widely expected to be introduced.When confronted by increased tax, we are already seeing more company car drivers taking a cash allowance – which generally means they move into older, less eco-friendly vehicles.This is not how the “” strategy will be delivered, so to encourage an electric future, something needs to change. Ensuring an electric future is not all down to politicians and infrastructure investment, car manufacturers have a very important role to play, too.We know from experience at LeasePlan that many company car drivers are eager to go green – but often, that demand isn’t met by supply.Granted, in the last few years, manufacturers have produced more electric vehicle models – but there still aren’t enough to fully meet the demands of company fleets.As it stands today, if you want either a small or luxury vehicle, then there is an EV for you.But there is nothing in the middle, no estate style vehicles or LCVs that offer enough range for the many trade fleets.The good news is that more mainstream make and models will start to appear later this year (we are assured) with a reasonable price tag.That said, commercial vehicles are still behind the curve and are only suitable for the last-mile or inner-city operations.Going forward, we must have commitments from manufacturers on guaranteed volumes for the UK market – particularly as there’s now the added uncertainty around how those manufacturers will balance their EU emission targets against their UK supply, post-Brexit.Otherwise, we run the risk of encouraging businesses to electrify their fleet, when the availability and choice is simply not sufficient.This could end up disappointing and frustrating businesses and drivers, . Connectivity could really encourage the adoption of greener vehicles. With connected vehicle data showing us mileage and other journey information, we could advise on which electric vehicles are appropriate for specific driver segments.However, we’re limited in this regard by the reluctance of most manufacturers to share their vehicle data.Too much of a vehicle’s data is kept in the digital equivalent of a safe box. This point is currently being debated by the EU and an outcome that delivers greater sharing could be a huge win on accelerating us along the Road to Zero.In car capability is also improving, with EVs launching in 2020 expected to be capable of car-to-car communication in real time, ensuring drivers are warned of congestion and hold-ups to allow for real time routing. Ultimately, businesses will be at the forefront of this change, whether they want to be or not.According to the , businesses are being held partially responsible for ensuring the UK is able to reduce its carbon levels by 100% before 2050.To do this, businesses will need to, if they haven’t started already, integrate sustainability plans company-wide.They will need to start forming their own strategies, both in welcoming and actively encouraging electric vehicles and properly equipping the workplace, by forecasting the volume of chargers they will require.With conventional cars and vans being forcibly phased out, they no longer have the option to remain passive observers.The challenges discussed above must be met with suitable solutions that are implemented simultaneously across the whole of the UK, to avoid a situation where some are left behind, without sufficient power.This can only be achieved by the government, businesses and manufacturers working cohesively to forge the path to a fully electric future.",12 Jun 2019 ,Is the future of electric vehicles in the UK grid-locked?,

Participants will demonstrate small, modular, cost-competitive desalination systems that use the power of ocean waves to supplement existing technologies that can provide drinking water to remote and coastal communities.“The Waves to Water Prize encourages companies, researchers, and investors who might not consider wave energy technologies to explore their application for desalination,” said Scott Jenne, a researcher with NREL’s Marine Energy team who helped inform the structure and content of the competition. “This project is multidisciplinary and a wide array of organizations and researchers should be interested in exploring how wave energy and desalination technology intersects. The new prize allows us to accelerate technological development by bringing in new perspectives of making use of wave energy.”The Waves to Water Prize consists of four stages, culminating in a contest that will require developers to deploy their solutions and compete across a variety of metrics. Graphic by Besiki Kazaishvili, NRELThe competition offers participants $2.5 million in cash prizes to spur innovation in wave energy-powered desalination systems. WPTO looks to support new solutions, designs, and strategies to accelerate technological development in support of three goals:Evaluate the economic basis for small-scale modular wave power desalinationDemonstrate desalination and marine renewable energy integrationValidate technologies in a field test setting that meet quantifiable benchmarks for freshwater production, ease of installation, cost, reliability, and survivability.The new competition explores the application of wave energy outside the context of utility scale electricity, something that proves to be more economical for technological development in the near term. The high premium placed on water availability allows for innovation in wave energy technology because the cost of research and development is outweighed by the need for clean drinking water.“In disaster or crisis scenarios, innovations in desalination technologies that supplement the supply of water using wave or other energy sources have the potential to make real impacts,” said Jenne. “Exploring the use of ocean waves to desalinate water for drinking makes a lot of sense.

"GE announced the availability of three new grid analytics that combine domain expertise with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to tackle pressing challenges in electric grid operations.
Image: The new grid analytics are connected via GE’s common Digital Energy data fabric. Photo: Courtesy of General Electric.The analytics use data from across transmission and distribution networks to help achieve goals for operational efficiency. The portfolio includes:Storm Readiness utilizes high-resolution weather forecasts, outage history, crew response and geographic information system (GIS) data to accurately forecast storm impact and prepare response crews and equipment ahead of impending weather. GE’s Storm Readiness analytic helps reduce outage restoration time, predict future outages, reduce operational spend and improve crew safety.Network Connectivity corrects and maintains network data integrity. Data errors, which often arise due to manual input of information at the customer or equipment level, can hinder emergency and outage response and lead to poor customer experience. GE’s Network Connectivity algorithms use GIS and other operational system data to detect, recommend and correct pervasive errors. Armed with better data, utilities can more efficiently dispatch crews, reduce outage restoration time and avoid incorrect outage notifications to customers.Effective Inertia gives enhanced visibility into transmission system operations. The operation of transmission networks is continuing to grow in complexity, in large part due to the influx of renewable generation. This has led to a massive displacement of “system inertia,” or the resiliency of power generation, given spikes in customer demand or reduced supply, due to unforeseen decreases in wind or sunlight. Ineffective management of a transmission system could result in blackouts and major financial and reputational penalties. GE’s Effective Inertia analytic uses ML to facilitate the measurement and forecasting of system inertia and enable a more stable grid.Steven Martin, acting CEO for GE Digital and chief digital officer for GE Power said, “The energy industry today is leveraging a small fraction of their operational data. Our grid analytics enable utilities to use more of that data and orchestrate their networks and the workers who operate them in ways previously unimagined – not only for current processes, but also for future unforeseen scenarios.”Brian Hurst, VP and chief analytics officer for Exelon Utilities, an early adopter of GE’s new grid analytics added, “When it comes to storm restoration, it will enable the utilities to become more surgical in prepositioning crews in advance of weather events – saving time, money, improving customer satisfaction and enhancing safety for employees. We are just beginning to scratch the surface on the value of analytics, and when we look at Distributed Energy Resources and the Internet of Things, it becomes increasingly important for the future.”The new grid analytics are connected via GE’s common Digital Energy data fabric. Unifying data on a secure, scalable and user-friendly platform drives efficiencies, allowing data stored in one location to be utilized by many solutions across the energy value chain, from generation to consumption. Users can in turn realize a network-effect of value, where improvements from one application amplify the benefits of another.",12 Jun 2019 ,GE introduces new analytics to advance electric grid operations,

"NEC Energy Solutions (NEC ES) has launched Adaptive Energy Warranty which uses energy storage system usage data to adapt a system's energy capacity warranty to fit a customer's use profile.
Image: Headquarters of NEC in Tokyo Japan. Photo: Courtesy of KW/Wikipedia.NEC’s proprietary, advanced AEROS software platform provides real time usage data to predict energy storage capacity degradation based on different use profiles. The result allows energy storage customers to maximize the value of their power with the knowledge and flexibility to use their system any way they want, without worrying about the warranty. The warranty will adapt depending on the use profile they choose.The energy storage capacity of any battery decreases with time and use. Some of the more important factors that impact energy storage capacity include energy throughput, cell temperature, average state of charge (SOC), depth of discharge (DOD), resting time and charge/discharge rate. Customers need to understand how a system’s energy storage capacity degrades or fades so that they can predict the life and performance of the system. However, due to changing market rules, customers often do not know exactly how they will use their system. NEC’s Adaptive Energy Warranty and its advanced AEROS software platform allows a customer to change their use profile to optimize the system while the warranty adapts accordingly.“Our unique Adaptive Energy Warranty, empowered by our proprietary AEROS software platform, is truly where electricity meets digital. We have over 10 years of data and more than 750MW of energy storage assets around the world that we have used to create mathematical models of energy capacity,” said Steve Fludder, CEO of NEC Energy Solutions. “These models enable our customers to adjust how they operate their systems to optimize value without having to worry about being out of warranty.”Source: Company Press Release",13 Jun 2019 ,NEC introduces Adaptive Energy Warranty to optimize value for energy storage customers,

"In conjunction with energy giant Vitol, renewable power investor Low Carbon is seeking to bolster energy storage in the UK through its VLC Energy venture
The UK was highlighted by the CCC for its rapid decarbonisationBattery storage is becoming increasingly sought after as nations the world over look to make more efficient use of the power they generate, and the situation is no different in the UK.The country has decarbonised at a rate of 3.7% per year since 2000, significantly faster than required by 2015’s Paris agreement, reflected by the Climate Change Committee’s most recent report highlighting Britain as having a particularly clean power sector.Roughly 20% of the UK’s electricity is accounted for by renewable sources, a figure predicted to rise to 30% by 2020, and .Without battery storage, however, much of this work is wasted, a present inevitability renewables investor Low Carbon is keen to avoid through its partnership with Vitol, the world’s largest independent energy trader, and .Low Carbon CEO Roy Bedlow said: “Multi-stakeholders across government, industry innovators, dynamic investors, climate change campaigners and our geographical advantage have driven and enabled the UK to become .“Additional innovation, further unlocking of institutional investors, public support and positive government policies for green growth and renewables at scale are all imperative if climate change is to be effectively mitigated for future generations.”, based in the UK, which espouses a commitment to making a positive and significant impact on the causes of climate change.It seeks to reduce emissions around the world and create a global low carbon future through leveraging renewable technologies and managing assets for both listed and unlisted third parties.Investing in everything from solar photovoltaic technology and wind power to energy storage and waste-to-power systems, the company has facilitated more than £400m of capital since its inception.More than 320MW of solar photovoltaic assets have been installed courtesy of Low Carbon’s investments, enough to power roughly 100,000 three-bedroom homes annually.“We firmly believe it is possible to provide all the energy we need through renewable sources, and this fund will help us further our ambition.”“The market has a good mix of proven low carbon technologies and we are seeing strong deal flow for investments across our target sectors.“We look forward to working with Vitol in identifying and closing new green infrastructure investments.” VLC Energy is a joint venture between Low Carbon and VPI Immingham, owner of one of the largest combined heat and power plants in Europe and a subsidiary of the Netherlands’ Vitol.With an initial €200m (£171m) allocation, it has been focusing on  in Europe over the past 12 months.Vitol’s group CEO Russell Hardy said: “In January, VLC Energy completed the construction of the UK’s largest battery park portfolio, a key resource for a system looking to build its renewable capacity.“Also with Low Carbon, we announced our intention to invest in renewable energy assets across Europe, with a focus on large-scale wind generation.“As a major participant in Europe’s power markets, it is important that we understand and participate in renewable power generation.”VLC Energy’s growing portfolio comprises two of the UK’s largest upcoming energy storage plants, both announced in early 2017, along with two of the country’s biggest operational facilities, located in Cumbria and Kent.The Cumbria-based plant is home to 900 battery modules with an installed energy capacity just shy of 7 megawatt hours (MWh), while the facility in Glassenbury, Kent, has 40MW.Both sites use lithium ion battery technology and comprise , in addition to the ability to respond to surges in energy supply and demand in less than a second.Mr Bedlow said: “These battery parks represent perhaps the greatest increase in UK energy storage capacity to date as part of National Grid’s EFR [enhanced frequency response] auction.“We’re delighted to have developed these sites with our partners at VPI Immingham, and look forward to expanding VLC Energy’s storage portfolio.“Energy storage is critical to managing the demands on the grid, ensuring consumer needs are met, and increasing our reliance on low-carbon forms of electricity generation.“These sites will help us tackle climate change and help the UK realise a cleaner and more energy efficient future.” As renewable energy continues its rise to prominence in the UK’s grid, , in particular, will become increasingly critical to maintaining a balance and stability.“The use of batteries can enhance National Grid’s ability to manage surges in supply from renewable energy sources, as well as surges in demand, and ultimately increase the Grid’s capacity to accommodate energy generated from renewables,” explained Mr Bedlow.“They will also be an integral part of building a smarter, cleaner and more flexible energy system for the UK.”VLC Energy won’t be the only venture dedicated to meeting the demand for energy storage, either.Earlier this year, the UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) launched the , which will make up to £20m available for up to
