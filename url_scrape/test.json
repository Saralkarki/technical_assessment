Photo: Courtesy of General Electric.The analytics use data from across transmission and distribution networks to help achieve goals for operational efficiency. The portfolio includes:Storm Readiness utilizes high-resolution weather forecasts, outage history, crew response and geographic information system (GIS) data to accurately forecast storm impact and prepare response crews and equipment ahead of impending weather. GE\u2019s Storm Readiness analytic helps reduce outage restoration time, predict future outages, reduce operational spend and improve crew safety.Network Connectivity corrects and maintains network data integrity. Data errors, which often arise due to manual input of information at the customer or equipment level, can hinder emergency and outage response and lead to poor customer experience. GE\u2019s Network Connectivity algorithms use GIS and other operational system data to detect, recommend and correct pervasive errors. Armed with better data, utilities can more efficiently dispatch crews, reduce outage restoration time and avoid incorrect outage notifications to customers.Effective Inertia gives enhanced visibility into transmission system operations. The operation of transmission networks is continuing to grow in complexity, in large part due to the influx of renewable generation. This has led to a massive displacement of \u201csystem inertia,\u201d or the resiliency of power generation, given spikes in customer demand or reduced supply, due to unforeseen decreases in wind or sunlight. Ineffective management of a transmission system could result in blackouts and major financial and reputational penalties. GE\u2019s Effective Inertia analytic uses ML to facilitate the measurement and forecasting of system inertia and enable a more stable grid.Steven Martin, acting CEO for GE Digital and chief digital officer for GE Power said, \u201cThe energy industry today is leveraging a small fraction of their operational data. Our grid analytics enable utilities to use more of that data and orchestrate their networks and the workers who operate them in ways previously unimagined \u2013 not only for current processes, but also for future unforeseen scenarios.\u201dBrian Hurst, VP and chief analytics officer for Exelon Utilities, an early adopter of GE\u2019s new grid analytics added, \u201cWhen it comes to storm restoration, it will enable the utilities to become more surgical in prepositioning crews in advance of weather events \u2013 saving time, money, improving customer satisfaction and enhancing safety for employees. We are just beginning to scratch the surface on the value of analytics, and when we look at Distributed Energy Resources and the Internet of Things, it becomes increasingly important for the future.\u201dThe new grid analytics are connected via GE\u2019s common Digital Energy data fabric. Unifying data on a secure, scalable and user-friendly platform drives efficiencies, allowing data stored in one location to be utilized by many solutions across the energy value chain, from generation to consumption.

{"article_title": ["Is the future of electric vehicles in the UK grid-locked?"], "article_date": ["12 Jun 2019 "], "article_body": "Here Matthew Walters, head of consultancy and customer data services at\u00a0LeasePlan UK, shares his thoughts on the future of electric vehicles in the UK\n(Credit: Tesla)Last year, the government announced that it would ban the sale of traditionally fuelled vehicles by 2040, after pressure from the EU and environmental groups to ensure a more environmentally-friendly Britain.However, despite positive reinforcement from the government and numerous studies showing , there is still nationwide doubt about the potential of an electric future.So, what is causing the UK\u2019s electric future to remain grid-locked?Here, I outline the biggest barriers facing the industry today which need addressing to help drive the electric revolution forward.Recent\u00a0\u00a0have shown that a major concern is the limited amount of public charging points available for EVs.This isn\u2019t an unfounded fear. Currently, the UK\u2019s average ratio of charge points to EVs is 43-to-one.Our\u00a0\u00a0revealed that the UK is\u00a0now lagging behind\u00a0our European neighbours in its electric vehicle preparation.Our annual EV Readiness Index showed that despite the UK currently holding the third\u00a0position for the number of EVs registered, the UK only has 0.27\u00a0charging plugs per 1,000\u00a0inhabitants.In comparison, \u00a0has a ratio of 4.8\u00a0charging plugs per 1,000\u00a0inhabitants, followed closely by Norway with 4.5.Whilst the anxiety will certainly be reduced as newer EVs increase to 250 miles and beyond, even if this becomes the norm, there is still concern over the range these vehicles can realistically offer.This will certainly be a source of apprehension for businesses that operate a multi-vehicle fleet and often travel long distances.Whilst you can plan a route, accounting for charging points along the way, congestion and traffic delays or diversions cannot always be foreseen.Ensuring the reliability of information on whether a charge point is in use is also something the industry and drivers will need to consider.The good news is that the government is encouraging the progression of charging infrastructure, with the announcement of a\u00a0.This fund also aims to ensure there are enough public facilities, a standardised way to pay and that each charge point is compatible with all available models.This should be seen as an ambitious starting point though, rather than an all-encompassing solution.Hopefully, the government\u2019s new investment will address the above concerns.However, even if there are sufficient charging points available, will the grid be able to support the EV framework, and how will this work?\u00a0Whilst the National Grid claims that it already has the necessary power to charge the\u00a0\u00a0EVs predicted to be in operation by 2040, it has acknowledged that it will lack the ability to charge all EVs simultaneously.This highlights an obvious issue; many drivers will want to charge their cars at the same time, either during work or in the evening.If there is not enough energy to meet this demand, it could lead to large areas being put at risk of power black-outs.Consequently, entire counties might wake up to find they have no electricity and their car won\u2019t start.To add to this, only\u00a0, meaning some businesses may be put under pressure to provide their employees with charging facilities at work.Right now, the National Grid predicts that we will depend upon a mix of smart meters and V2G (Vehicle to Grid) technology to ensure demand does not outweigh supply.In an ideal world, vehicles that plug in wouldn\u2019t charge until off-peak hours, but instead act as a giant battery back up to the grid for peak hours when most households are maximising their energy consumption.Whilst this is certainly not a pipe dream with several successful trials underway, this would require extensive change of the current home charge network to ensure V2G and more rapid charge capabilities, as well as a new Feed In Tariff similar to .\u00a0According to our own\u00a0, the UK is the fifth most cost-effective place in Europe to own an EV \u2013 behind Hungary, Poland, Norway and the Netherlands.However, policymakers should not be complacent. The whole life cost for an electric vehicle still must improve significantly.List prices remain high and the second hand market is still not mature, so the cost for a broadly similar petrol equivalent is still the most economic choice in most instances.We should also keep a cautious eye on any changes to vehicle taxation which are expected to be announced in the coming months, as well as any further reduction in the EV grant structure.The government must maintain the 2% tax band, low Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) and current EV grant levels if their numbers are to continue to increase.We must also give thought to what will be introduced to plug the gap in the treasury\u2019s finances  and fuel duty income reduces with road user pricing widely expected to be introduced.When confronted by increased tax, we are already seeing more company car drivers taking a cash allowance \u2013 which generally means they move into older, less eco-friendly vehicles.This is not how the \u201c\u201d strategy will be delivered, so to encourage an electric future, something needs to change.\u00a0Ensuring an electric future is not all down to politicians and infrastructure investment, car manufacturers have a very important role to play, too.We know from experience at LeasePlan that many company car drivers are eager to go green \u2013 but often, that demand isn\u2019t met by supply.Granted, in the last few years, manufacturers have produced more electric vehicle models \u2013 but there still aren\u2019t enough to fully meet the demands of company fleets.As it stands today, if you want either a small or luxury vehicle, then there is an EV for you.But there is nothing in the middle, no estate style vehicles or LCVs that offer enough range for the many trade fleets.The good news is that more mainstream make and models will start to appear later this year (we are assured) with a reasonable price tag.That said, commercial vehicles are still behind the curve and are only suitable for the last-mile or inner-city operations.Going forward, we must have commitments from manufacturers on guaranteed volumes for the UK market \u2013 particularly as there\u2019s now the added uncertainty around how those manufacturers will balance their EU emission targets against their UK supply, post-Brexit.Otherwise, we run the risk of encouraging businesses to electrify their fleet, when the availability and choice is simply not sufficient.This could end up disappointing and frustrating businesses and drivers, .\u00a0Connectivity could really encourage the adoption of greener vehicles. With connected vehicle data showing us mileage and other journey information, we could advise on which electric vehicles are appropriate for specific driver segments.However, we\u2019re limited in this regard by the reluctance of most manufacturers to share their vehicle data.Too much of a vehicle\u2019s data is kept in the digital equivalent of a safe box. This point is currently being debated by the EU and an outcome that delivers greater sharing could be a huge win on accelerating us along the Road to Zero.In car capability is also improving, with EVs launching in 2020 expected to be capable of car-to-car communication in real time, ensuring drivers are warned of congestion and hold-ups to allow for real time routing.\u00a0Ultimately, businesses will be at the forefront of this change, whether they want to be or not.According to the\u00a0, businesses are being held partially responsible for ensuring the UK is able to reduce its carbon levels by 100% before 2050.To do this, businesses will need to, if they haven\u2019t started already, integrate sustainability plans company-wide.They will need to start forming their own strategies, both in welcoming and actively encouraging electric vehicles and properly equipping the workplace, by forecasting the volume of chargers they will require.With conventional cars and vans being forcibly phased out, they no longer have the option to remain passive observers.The challenges discussed above must be met with suitable solutions that are implemented simultaneously across the whole of the UK, to avoid a situation where some are left behind, without sufficient power.This can only be achieved by the government, businesses and manufacturers working cohesively to forge the path to a fully electric future."},
