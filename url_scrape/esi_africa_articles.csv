International Finance Corporation (IFC) and HSBC Global Asset Management announced
the establishment of the first global green bond fund targeting “real economy”
issuers in emerging markets.The fund is also aimed at increasing access
to climate finance and promoting the further development of green bond
markets. The Real Economy Green Investment Opportunity (REGIO) Fund is expected to catalyse at least $500 million to $700 million in multilateral and private sector capital to support well-diversified climate-smart investments in developing countries around the world—largely through green bonds issued by non-financial, or real sector, companies.  “This innovative fund will provide new opportunities for an important class of borrowers in green bond markets,” said IFC's CEO, Philippe Le Houérou.Le Houérou added: “The capital raised by REGIO will make a vital contribution to the fight against climate change and further promote sustainability-oriented capital markets.” Non-financial borrowers represent an
untapped opportunity in the global green bond market, IFC noted.REGIO will increase access to climate
finance for these borrowers by targeting a mix of manufacturing, agribusiness,
services, infrastructure, and sub-sovereign bonds, in addition to a smaller
allocation of financial-sector bonds. IFC will provide a $100 million anchor investment in the fund. HSBC will invest up to $75 million. The fund will have a total life of up to 15 years, including a seven-year investment period.  “HSBC Global Asset Management has deep expertise and experience in investing in global emerging markets and a strong commitment to playing its part in mobilising capital to deliver on the UN Sustainable Development Goals and transition to a low-carbon global economy,” said Sridhar Chandrasekharan, Global CEO at HSBC Global Asset Management. REGIO draws on IFC’s leadership in the green bond market—as an issuer, investor, and standard setter. Since 2010, IFC has issued 143 green bonds in 16 currencies, totalling over $9 billion.  REGIO aims to attract private capital by helping institutional investors attain their goals of allocating resources to developing economies, while achieving long-term sustainable growth and meeting fiduciary obligations. In particular, the fund will help address the demand for climate finance by providing an innovative, sectorally diversified vehicle to investors who currently lack the capability to invest in individual green bond transactions.A proprietary green impact framework and clear sustainability governance policies will ensure that REGIO adheres to measurable green impact objectives, both for targeted issuers and transparent impact reporting. To bolster the supply of green bonds issued by real sector borrowers, REGIO’s investment activities will also be complemented by a Technical Assistance Facility, managed by IFC.Since you're here, this will also be of interest to you: Nigeria moves to its second green bond issuanceLog in to leave a comment ","June 5, 2019",Pioneering green bond fund to focus on emerging markets,https://1st4u616hq2s3alsy93h5ipb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/go-green.jpg

of ACTOM, has completed the stator rewind without incident at the Ingula plant.
The contract involved the complete rewind of a 373MVA stator for one of
Ingula’s four 14-pole motor generators. According to Richard Botton, managing
director of Marthinusen & Coutts, the 342MW unit is among the biggest in
South Africa with a core diameter measuring 5 metres, a core length of 3,2
metres and a rotor mass of 500 tonnes.“As the stator was located deep in the
turbine floor, all the winding was required to be conducted on site,” says
Botton. “In this complicated repair, each replacement coil set was fitted, connected and brazed on-site from pre-manufactured and pre-packed components supplied by the OEM. The most painstaking process, conducted to the highest standards, was the resistive brazing on 1,824 joints.”Also read this: No unemployment problem in South Africa says SACEECThe company carried out the work with

"Global solar panel manufacturer Jinko Solar has reported sluggish movement in China’s solar photovoltaic (PV) power additions in 2019.  Global solar panel manufacturer Jinko Solar has reported sluggish movement in China’s solar photovoltaic (PV) power additions in 2019.  According to Jinko Solar's vice president, Qian Jing, China may add 30 to 40 gigawatts of solar power in 2019, down from 44 gigawatts the previous year, Bloomberg reported.She added that the potential slump will come despite additions accelerating in the second half of the year, she said. Bloomberg reported that China is shifting to a more market-driven approach in the solar power sector to reduce the financial burden from subsidies and cut back on unused capacity. The news agency added that a lack of clarity remains around how it will develop non-subsidised projects, as well as delays in regulators determining which proposed projects can still receive subsidies, which has left some developments in limbo.The company expects that more than 85% of revenue this year will come from overseas markets, up from 80% in 2018, Qian said.

Global economic growth is forecast to ease to a weaker-than-expected 2.6% in 2019 before inching up to 2.7% in 2020, states a World Bank report. Growth in emerging
market and developing economies is expected to stabilise next year as some
countries move past periods of financial strain, but economic momentum remains
weak.Emerging and
developing economy growth is constrained by sluggish investment, and risks are
tilted to the downside. These risks include rising trade barriers, renewed financial stress, and sharper-than-expected slowdowns in several major economies, the World Bank says in its June 2019 Global Economic Prospects: Heightened Tensions, Subdued Investment. Structural problems that misallocate or discourage investment also weigh on the outlook.“Stronger economic
growth is essential to reducing poverty and improving living standards. Current economic momentum remains
weak, while heightened debt levels and subdued investment growth in developing
economies are holding countries back from achieving their potential,”
said World Bank Group President
David Malpass. “It’s urgent that
countries make significant structural reforms that improve the business climate
and attract investment. They also need to make debt management and transparency
a high priority so that new debt adds to growth and investment,” Malpass
stated.Growth among advanced
economies as a group is anticipated to slow in 2019, especially in the Euro
Area, due to weaker exports and investment. US growth is forecast to ease to
2.5% this year and decelerate to 1.7% in 2020. Euro Area growth is projected to
hover around 1.4% in 2020-21, with softness in trade and domestic demand
weighing on activity despite continued support from monetary policy.Meanwhile, growth among emerging market and developing economies is projected
to fall to a four-year low of 4% in 2019 before recovering to 4.6% in 2020. “While almost every economy faces
headwinds, the poorest countries face the most daunting challenges because of
fragility, geographic isolation, and entrenched poverty,” noted World Bank Group Vice President for Equitable
Growth, Finance and Institutions, Ceyla Pazarbasioglu.“Unless they can get onto a faster growth
trajectory, the goal of lowering extreme poverty under 3% by 2030 will remain
unreachable.”Download the June

"In Africa, it is estimated that by 2035 solar photovoltaic (PV) projects will contribute 9.8% of overall electricity generation making way for solar module efficiency research and development. In Africa, it is estimated that by 2035 solar photovoltaic (PV) projects will contribute 9.8% of overall electricity generation making way for solar module efficiency research and development. In South Africa, the National Energy Regulator of
South Africa (NERSA) announced recently that it has the go-ahead to license 500
megawatts (MW) per year of embedded generation projects each with an installed
capacity of under 10MW. Those projects will now be able to proceed without having to seek prior approval from the energy minister. These sorts of projects typically cover residential, commercial and industrial sites, and would include properties such as retail centres, warehouses and offices. Did you know? Capetonians must register their small-scale embedded generation (SSEG) systems. Find out more here. Did you know? Along with shifts in the traditional energy market,
consistent and rapid innovation in the field of solar PV places this energy
generation alternative at the forefront of efforts to reduce our collective
dependence on fossil fuels. So says Tim Frankish, managing director of
SolarSaver, an independent local renewables company that provides capex-free
solar solutions to businesses both here and in a growing sub-Saharan
market.  Frankish states: “The solar energy sector is highly
innovative and the past few years have seen a rapid growth in the range of
available solar panels, also known as modules. These modules now come in
innumerable different sizes and capacities, and employ a range of different
technologies. These developments are all aimed at driving efficiency, from both
a technical and a financial perspective.”  Manufacturers, such as Canadian Solar, have been
successful in developing higher performance modules that include features such
as passivated emitter real cell (PERC) and half-cut cells. “These technologies now see Canadian Solar’s HiKu
modules, for example, achieving efficiencies of up to 18.8% on 415 watt
ratings,” notes Frankish. “That’s a big jump from the 16.4% efficiencies and
260 watt ratings we saw as recently as 3 years ago.” The use of high solar module efficiency means that
installers require fewer of them to yield the same system output. This benefits
clients through a reduction in a project’s BOS (balance of system) costs and
enables more power to be generated off a smaller footprint. The latter is
particularly beneficial for high energy consumers that have limited roof space,
for example.Another innovation that is making a significant impact
on the solar landscape is the bifacial solar module. Bifacial modules
include solar cells on both the front and rear sides, enabling sunlight to be
captured both from above and below.  Frankish explains, “In contrast to the one-sided
absorption of traditional panels, bifacials are also able to absorb light that
is reflected off the ground or roof. Our experience shows that these modules,
if installed correctly, can yield 10 to 30% more than similar systems using
traditional modules.”  SolarSaver incorporated bifacial modules in its solar
installation at Gondwana Collection’s new lodge in Namibia, The Desert Grace.
The modules were mounted on custom-built carport structures and Frankish
believes they brought more to the project than just higher energy yields and solar
module efficiency. “Bifacial modules don’t have any plastic backsheets so
they look great from below. Our engineers were therefore able to combine
performance and aesthetics to give our clients a truly unique solution,” he
explains.Frankish says that bifacial modules do however pose a
challenge for parties looking to finance solar projects. “The challenge with
bifacial panels is the unpredictability of power output as the type of ground
behind the modules, and the way the modules are mounted, has a big influence on
the levels of output achieved. “It can therefore be difficult to model what the
installation will produce. The Desert Grace project was the first installation
in Africa to utilise Canadian Solar’s bifacial modules and provided us with an
important test case.” SolarSaver has subsequently used bifacial modules at a number of other sites in Namibia and will soon start installation of similar carport structures at Cape Point Vineyards, a wine estate near Cape Town.This story will also interest you: Tilt solar PV market to record 9% growth in five years’ timeLog in to leave a comment ","June 6, 2019",Solar module efficiency increasing as demand rises,https://1st4u616hq2s3alsy93h5ipb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Hatfield-VW-Braamfontein-SA-1.jpg

This also opens opportunities for private sector participation in the energy generation business, which introduces competition into the electricity generation market in the interest of price reductions,” said Ntombifuthi Ntuli, SAWEA board member and research group leader for the energy industry at the CSIR Energy Centre.When asked if there will be a preference towards independent providers who generate electricity through sustainable means, SAWEA responded in the affirmative, stating that renewable energy Independent Power Producers (IPPs) have the ability to raise finance for electricity build expansion and develop smaller projects that reach commercial operation in an average of 24-months, which is far quicker than new build coal. These renewable projects also contribute to a massive reduction in the energy sector carbon emissions and water consumption.

not planned properly, the integration of SSEGs can pose system operation
challenges in a long run,” explained Ntuli.SAWEA says that the delayed announcement of the Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) should not have an impact as the Energy Minister’s announcement has capped the number of projects to be licensed to a total of 500MW, whilst the current IRP Draft allocated a total of 2,600MW to embedded generation.

its latest in-depth review of the UK’s energy policies, welcoming reforms that
aim to promote decarbonisation and innovation in clean energy technologies.The review
specifically highlights the UK government’s track record in climate action,
both at home and globally.“The United Kingdom
has shown real results in terms of boosting investment in renewables, reducing
emissions and maintaining energy security,” said Dr Fatih Birol, the IEA’s
Executive Director.Birol added: “It now
faces the challenge of continuing its transition while ensuring the resilience
of its energy system.”In 2017,
energy-related CO2 emissions in the UK reached the lowest
levels since 1888. The report finds that
this rapid reduction was achieved in part through significant renewable
investment following the UK’s Electricity Market Reform (EMR). By 2030, the UK is
forecast to see its share of variable renewables pass 50%. Amid this rapid
change to a power system with a high share of wind and solar, market rules will
need to accommodate flexibility, including interconnections, storage and demand
response to maintain electricity security.“This report highlights our reputation as a world leader in the global shift to greener, cleaner economies, cutting emissions by more than 40% since 1990 while growing our economy,” said Chris Skidmore, the UK Energy and Clean Growth Minister.Energy storage is a key player in the energy transition. You may find this interesting: Coalition to accelerate energy storage adoption in developing countriesSkidmore continued: “We can be proud of
dramatically decarbonising our energy system thanks to record levels of
investment in renewables, while security of supply has never been in doubt. But
we’re not complacent and we’re now on a path to become the first major economy
to legislate for net-zero emissions to end our contribution to global warming
entirely.”The IEA review finds that outside of the UK power sector, there is still significant potential for improvements. Reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in
line with the Paris Agreement on climate change will require the scaling up of
clean energy investment in the transport and heat sectors, a major focus of the
government’s Clean Growth Strategy.According to the report, action in these
sectors will require a broad mix of solutions including technology innovation
and electrification, stimulated by fiscal policies and energy efficiency that
can help offset higher power costs. Finally, streamlining regulation in
electricity wholesale and retail markets will be critical to ensure more
effective and competitive markets, the report noted. This will support electrification for the longer-term decarbonisation of the economy by 2050.While you're here,  you may find this interesting: Waste heat: an untapped energy source in EuropeLog in to leave a comment ","June 10, 2019",UK gov promotes clean energy reforms,https://1st4u616hq2s3alsy93h5ipb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/14123078_l-optimised.jpg
"The Centre for Environmental Rights (CER) has written a letter to President Cyril Ramaphosa urging him to appoint individuals who will be passionate in addressing the global threat of climate change.The Centre for Environmental Rights (CER) has written a letter to President Cyril Ramaphosa urging him to appoint individuals who will be passionate in addressing the global threat of climate change.This call has been made just ahead of Ramaphosa’s upcoming cabinet selection, and CER has recommended that a climate change portfolio be created in the Presidency, alternatively that a new Department of Energy and Climate be created; and that no attempt be made to merge the ""dysfunctional Department of Water & Sanitation with another department"".The organisation has called on the President, when making
his cabinet selection, to recognise:In the
letter to the President, CER highlights some of the key challenges facing
the Departments of Water and Sanitation, Environmental Affairs, Energy and
Mineral Resources and provides advice on the key qualities that Ministers and
Deputy Ministers appointed to those portfolios should have in order to lead institutional
reform.Firstly, CER writes that the Department of Energy is currently making decisions that have far-reaching implications for South Africa’s ability to ensure a just transition from fossil fuels to clean energy and our resilience to the market upheaval and the natural storms and droughts coming our way. It calls for the Minister to be someone with a clear vision
for a just transition away from fossil fuels to clean, cheap, renewable energy
for South Africa, and the courage to stand up to the vested interests that are
holding the country back and throttling its ability to improve the quality of
life of everyone in South Africa, including the most vulnerable in our society.Mainstreaming of climate change – getting appropriate
prioritisation of climate considerations across all sectors of government and
appropriate coordinated action taken – is crucial to an effective response to
climate change. Therefore, a Climate Change portfolio is better positioned inside the Presidency itself than its current home in the Department of Environmental Affairs. Another option is to create a new Department of Energy and Climate, which will send a strong signal that the ANC and Cabinet acknowledge the massive risk that South Africa faces, and how decisions about energy are directly linked to South Africa’s future in a changed climate.In relation to Department
of Water & Sanitation (DWS), CER describes the risks posed to health
and service delivery due to regulatory dysfunction and corruption at the DWS
and at many local governments. “We strongly motivate for the DWS not to be merged
with another portfolio to allow a new Minister to focus on the mammoth task of
rebuilding and reforming this key department,” reads the letter.CER warns of the paralysis and delay caused by poorly implemented mergers, and the need for a strong Minister to fill the extraordinarily high number of vacancies at the DWS and appoint a competent senior management group as soon as possible.In relation to the Department of Environmental Affairs, CER says it would not be
opposed to a re-merger with Tourism, but argues for a powerful and
uncompromised Minister, given the central role this department plays in our
climate resilience which involves holding the environment (soil, air, water,
biodiversity) in public trust for all the people of South Africa as well as
future generations.In the letter, CER argues that leading South Africa’s Department of Mineral Resources in
2019 requires a very different approach: someone who can ensure regulatory
certainty, but also effective and committed regulation. Crucially, the new Minister of Mineral Resources has to
account for and respond to the extraordinary frustrations and anger of both
mining-affected communities across the country about the way in which their
lives, homes and livelihoods have been shattered by effectively unregulated
mining, and communities who have in mind a different development path, and are
holding out, at great risk and cost, against that same devastation they see in
other parts of South Africa.The CER also argues that the Minister of Mineral Resources
also needs to be smart enough not to be hoodwinked by international mining
companies now offloading the dregs of a dying coal mining industry under the
guise of black economic empowerment, and instead prevent these companies from
walking away scot-free from the absolute devastation of the natural and social
environment they have profited from for the last 60 years.Log in to leave a comment ","May 20, 2019",President Ramaphosa urged to establish a new Climate Change portfolio,https://1st4u616hq2s3alsy93h5ipb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Cyril-Ramaphosa.jpg

"The International Energy Agency has noted that global demand for natural gas is set to keep growing over the next five years, driven by strong consumption in fast-growing Asian economies and supported by the continued development of the international gas trade. The International Energy Agency has noted that global demand for natural gas is set to keep growing over the next five years, driven by strong consumption in fast-growing Asian economies and supported by the continued development of the international gas trade. Demand for natural gas grew 4.6% in 2018, its fastest annual pace since 2010, according to the IEA’s latest annual market report, Gas 2019. Gas accounted for almost half the increase in primary energy consumption worldwide. Demand is expected to rise by more than 10% over the next five years, reaching more than 4.3 trillion cubic metres (tcm) in 2024. “Natural gas helped to reduce air pollution and limit the rise in energy-related CO2 emissions by displacing coal and oil in power generation, heating and industrial uses,” said Dr Fatih Birol, the IEA’s executive director. “Natural gas can contribute to a cleaner global energy system. But it faces its own challenges, including remaining price competitive in emerging markets and reducing methane emissions along the natural gas supply chain.” China is expected to account for more than 40% of global gas demand growth to 2024, propelled by the government’s goal of improving air quality by shifting away from coal. Chinese natural gas consumption grew 18% in 2018 but is expected to slow to an average annual rate of 8% to 2024 as a result of slower economic growth. The IEA also sees strong growth in gas consumption in other Asian countries, particularly in South Asia. In Bangladesh, India and Pakistan, the industrial sector is the main contributor to growth, especially for fertilisers to meet the needs of growing populations. Industrial use of natural gas, both as a fuel and a feedstock, is set to expand at an average annual rate of 3% and account for almost half of the rise in global consumption to 2024. Power generation remains the largest consumer of natural gas, in spite of slower growth due to strong competition from renewables and coal. Gas 2019 also focuses on the role of liquefied natural gas (LNG) at sea, which is set to emerge as a fast-growing alternative fuel because of stricter rules on sulphur content that take effect in January 2020. Supplies to meet growing global demand for natural gas will come from both new domestic production in fast-growing economies but also increasingly from major exporting countries, led by the development of abundant shale gas resources in the US. The strong growth in LNG export capacity will enable international trade to play a growing role in the development of natural gas markets as they move towards greater globalisation. Investment in LNG projects have rebounded in 2018 after several years of decline, and a large number of projects due to take final investment decision in 2019 is likely to further support trade and market expansion. However, more investment will be needed in the future. The recent convergence in market prices in major regions gives an indication of the increasing globalisation of the natural gas trade. Establishing market-driven pricing mechanisms in fast-growing economies remains a challenge, however. Recent reforms in major markets are sending encouraging signals, but more will be required to ensure the sustainable market-driven development of natural gas in these economies.

"A new report from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Innovation Outlook: smart charging for electric vehicles, guides countries on how to exploit the complementarity potential between renewable electricity and electric vehicles (EVs).A new report from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Innovation Outlook: smart charging for electric vehicles, guides countries on how to exploit the complementarity potential between renewable electricity and electric vehicles (EVs).With many new EVs now out-performing their fossil-powered
counterparts’ capabilities on the road, energy planners are looking to bring
innovation to the garage — 95% of a car’s time is spent parked. The result is that with careful planning and the right infrastructure in place, parked and plugged-in EVs could be the battery banks of the future, stabilising electric grids powered by wind and solar energy.“EVs at scale can create vast electricity storage capacity,
but if everyone simultaneously charges their cars in the morning or evening,
electricity networks can become stressed,” noted Dolf Gielen, Director of IRENA’s
Innovation and Technology Centre.Gielen added: “The timing of charging is therefore critical.
‘Smart charging’, which both charges vehicles and supports the grid, unlocks a
virtuous circle in which renewable energy makes transport cleaner and EVs
support larger shares of renewables.”Smart charging means adapting the charging cycle of EVs to
both the conditions of the power system and the needs of vehicle users. “Smart charging is one of the innovations IRENA is closely following that
presents multiple benefits. By decreasing EV-charging-stress on the grid, smart
charging can make electricity systems more flexible for renewable energy
integration, and provides a low-carbon electricity option to address the
transport sector, all while meeting mobility needs,” said Gielen.The rapid uptake of EVs around the world, means smart charging
could save billions of dollars in grid investments needed to meet EV loads in a
controlled manner. For example, the distribution system operator in Hamburg —
Stromnetz Hamburg — is testing a smart charging system that uses digital
technologies that control the charging of vehicles based on systems and
customers’ requirements. When fully implemented, this would reduce the need for grid
investments in the city due to the load of charging EVs by 90%.IRENA’s analysis indicates that if most of the passenger
vehicles sold from 2040 onwards were electric, more than 1 billion EVs could be
on the road by 2050 — up from around 6 million today —dwarfing stationary
battery capacity. Projections suggest that in 2050, around 14 TWh of EV
batteries could be available to provide grid services, compared to just 9 TWh
of stationary batteries.The implementation of smart charging systems ranges from
basic to advanced, according to Francisco Boshell, an IRENA analyst monitoring
the development and implementation of EV strategies around the world. “The simplest approaches encourage consumers to defer their
charging from peak to off-peak periods. More advanced approaches using digital
technology (PDF), such as ‘direct control mechanisms’ may in the near
future serve the electricity system by delivering close-to real-time energy
balancing and ancillary services,” explains Boshell.An advanced smart charging approach, called Vehicle-to-Grid
(V2G), allows EVs not to just withdraw electricity from the grid, but to also
inject electricity back to the grid. V2G technology may create a business case for car owners,
via aggregators (PDF), to provide ancillary services to
the grid. However, to be attractive for car owners, smart charging must satisfy
the mobility needs, meaning cars should be charged when needed, at the lowest
cost, and owners should possibly be remunerated for providing services to the
grid. Policy instruments, such as rebates for the installation of
smart charging points as well as time-of-use tariffs (PDF), may incentivise a wide
deployment of smart charging.“We’ve seen this tested in the UK, Netherlands and Denmark,”
Boshell stated, adding “for example, since 2016, Nissan, Enel and Nuvve have
partnered and worked on an energy management solution that allows vehicle
owners and energy users to operate as individual energy hubs. “Their two pilot projects in Denmark and the UK have allowed
owners of Nissan EVs to earn money by sending power to the grid through Enel’s
bidirectional chargers.”While EVs have a lot to offer towards accelerating variable
renewable energy deployment, their uptake also brings technical challenges that
need to be overcome.IRENA analysis suggests uncontrolled and simultaneous
charging of EVs could significantly increase congestion in power systems and
peak load. Resulting in limitations to increase the share of solar PV
and wind in power systems, and the need for additional investment costs in
electrical infrastructure in form of replacing and additional cables,
transformers, switchgears, etc., respectively.An increase in autonomous and ‘mobility-as-a-service’
driving — i.e. innovations for car-sharing or those that would allow your car
to taxi strangers when you are not using it — could disrupt the potential
availability of grid-stabilising plugged-in EVs, as batteries will be connected
and available to the grid less often.It has also become clear that fast and ultra-fast charging are a priority for the mobility sector, however, slow charging is actually better suited for smart charging, as batteries are connected and available to the grid longer. For slow charging, locating charging infrastructure at home
and at the workplace is critical, an aspect to be considered during infrastructure
planning. Fast and ultra-fast charging may increase the peak demand stress on
local grids. Solutions such as battery swapping, charging stations with buffer
storage, and night EV fleet charging, might become necessary, in combination
with fast and ultra-fast charging, to avoid high infrastructure investments.To learn more about smart charging read the Summary

"The transportation of both Kangnas Wind Farm and Perdekraal East Wind Farm’s turbine tower sections have commenced, making their way from the West Coast’s Port of Saldanha and Atlantis. The transportation of both Kangnas Wind Farm and Perdekraal East Wind Farm’s turbine tower sections have commenced, making their way from the West Coast’s Port of Saldanha and Atlantis. These two giant projects will be connected to
the country’s national grid by August 2020, forming part of the government’s Renewable
Energy Industry Power Producer Procurement Programmes (REI4Ps) Bid Window 4, both
of which incorporate significant levels of locally manufactured components. The first tower sections departed from Atlantis, West Coast of Cape Town on 20 May 2019, with blades, nacelles and other components travelling from the Port of Saldanha. It is expected that all 1,090 turbine components, weighing in collectively at an impressive 56,000 tonnes, will have reached their respective sites of Springbok, in the Northern Cape and the Witzenberg Municipality, in the Western Cape, before end January 2020. “This is a considerable undertaking as we
will have more than 1,000 abnormal loads traversing the country, between now
and January next year,” explained Christo Loots, construction programme manager
for Kangnas Wind Farm and Perdekraal East Wind Farm.These two projects, both of which boast
very high local content percentages, will additionally bring in substantial
community investment over 20 years once they start operating in 2020 and
generate a combined 932,3GWh/year of clean, renewable power into the grid. This
is equivalent to the energy needs of 215,000 homes each year.There are 33 wind farms at various stages of development throughout South Africa, including these two giant projects.  The country has more than 1,365 wind turbines generators equalling 3,672MW installed capacity of which 2,020MW is fully operational.  The wind sector has invested R80.6 billion in South Africa and is helping to drive local manufacturing industries, which provide thousands of home-grown jobs.  One such manufacturer, GRI, located in the Special
Economic Zone (SEZ) for Green Technologies, is producing the massive turbine
tower sections for Kangnas Wind Farm and Perdekraal East Wind Farm.  GRI is 25% owned by local Black
shareholders, whilst their 250 or so employees have benefited from skills
transfer, some seeing training and experience abroad, and bringing their skills
back to South Africa to ramp up to full operations again.  According to Green Cape, the SEZ has already attracted R680 million in green technology investments and has created over 300 jobs. It is expected that the zone will attract a further R3.7 billion of investment by renewable energy and other manufacturers, and nearly 3,000 jobs are expected to be created by 2030 if these investments are realised. Perdekraal East Wind Farm is situated in
the Witzenberg Local Municipality, in the Western Cape. Approximately 80 km
North-West of the Ceres (town) and 198.26 km north east of the Port of
Saldanha. Kangnas Wind Farm is situated in the Nama Khoi Municipal area, in the Northern Cape.

"Global energy
investment stabilised in 2018, ending three consecutive years of decline, as
capital spending on oil, gas and coal supply bounced back.Global energy
investment stabilised in 2018, ending three consecutive years of decline, as
capital spending on oil, gas and coal supply bounced back.However, investment stalled for energy efficiency and renewables, according to the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) latest annual review.The findings of the World Energy Investment 2019 report
signal a growing mismatch between current trends and the paths to meeting the
Paris Agreement and other sustainable development goals.Global energy investment totalled more than $1.8 trillion in
2018, a level similar to 2017. For the third year in a row, the power sector attracted more
investment than the oil and gas industry. The biggest jump in overall energy investment was in the US,
where it was boosted by higher spending in upstream supply, particularly shale,
but also electricity networks. The increase narrowed the gap between the US and China,
which remained the world’s largest investment destination.Still, even as investments stabilised, approvals for new
conventional oil and gas projects fell short of what would be needed to meet
continued robust growth in global energy demand. At the same time, there are few signs of the substantial
reallocation of capital towards energy efficiency and cleaner supply sources
that is needed to bring investments in line with the Paris Agreement and other
sustainable development goals.“Energy investments now face unprecedented uncertainties,
with shifts in markets, policies and technologies,” said Dr Fatih Birol, the
IEA’s executive director. “But the bottom line is that the world is not investing
enough in traditional elements of supply to maintain today’s consumption
patterns, nor is it investing enough in cleaner energy technologies to change
course. Whichever way you look, we are storing up risks for the future,” Birol
added.The world is witnessing a shift in investments towards energy supply projects that have shorter lead times. In power generation and the upstream oil and gas sector, the
report indicates that the industry is bringing capacity to market more than 20%
faster than at the beginning of the decade. This reflects industry and investors seeking to better manage risks in a changing energy system, and also improved project management and lower costs for shorter-cycle assets such as solar PV, onshore wind and US shale.Even though decisions to invest in coal-fired power plants
declined to their lowest level this century and retirements rose, the global
coal power fleet continued to expand, particularly in developing Asian
countries.The continuing investments in coal plants, which have a long
lifecycle, appear to be aimed at filling a growing gap between soaring demand
for power and a levelling off of expected generation from low-carbon
investments (renewables and nuclear). Without carbon capture technology or incentives for earlier
retirements, coal power and the high CO2 emissions it produces would remain
part of the global energy system for many years to come. At the same time, to meet sustainability goals, investment in energy efficiency would need to accelerate while spending on renewable power doubles by 2030.Among major countries and regions, India had the second
largest jump in energy investment in 2018 after the US. However, the poorest regions of the world, such as
sub-Saharan Africa, face persistent financing risks. They only received around 15% of investment in 2018 even
though they account for 40% of the global population. Far more capital needs to flow to the least developed
countries in order to meet sustainable development goals.The report also found that public spending on energy
research, development and demonstration (RD&D) is far short of what is
needed. While public energy RD&D spending rose modestly in 2018,
led by the US and China, its share of gross domestic product remained flat and
most countries are not spending more of their economic output on energy
research.“Current investment trends show the need for bolder
decisions required to make the energy system more sustainable,” Dr Birol said. “Government leadership is critical to reduce risks for
investors in the emerging sectors that urgently need more capital to get the
world on the right track.”Log in to leave a comment ","May 22, 2019",Global energy investment stabilised above $1.8tn in 2018,

"Despite significant
progress in recent years, the world is falling short of meeting the global
energy targets set in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)
for 2030. Despite significant
progress in recent years, the world is falling short of meeting the global
energy targets set in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)
for 2030. Ensuring affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy
for all by 2030 remains possible but will require more sustained efforts,
particularly to reach some of the world’s poorest populations and to improve
energy sustainability.This is according to a new report produced by the
collaboration between the International Energy Agency (IEA) the International
Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD),
the World Bank and the World Health Organization (WHO).Notable progress has been made on energy access in recent
years, with the number of people living without electricity dropping to roughly
840 million from 1 billion in 2016 and 1.2 billion in 2010. “The progress we have seen over the last few years is encouraging- the number of people without access to electricity has dropped to 840 million- but we still have a great deal of work to do as much of this population lives in the poorest countries and most remote locations,” noted Riccardo Puliti, senior director for energy and extractives at the World Bank. Puliti added: “This report demonstrates the importance of
sound planning, integrating grid and off-grid approaches, a focus on
affordability and reliability, and addressing gender inequalities.”India, Bangladesh, Kenya and Myanmar are among countries
that made the most progress since 2010. However, without more sustained and stepped-up actions, 650
million people will still be left without access to electricity in 2030. Nine
out of 10 of them will be living in sub-Saharan Africa.Tracking SDG7:
The Energy Progress Report also shows that great efforts have been
made to deploy renewable energy technology for electricity generation and to
improve energy efficiency across the world. Tracking SDG7:
The Energy Progress Report Nonetheless, access to clean cooking solutions and the use
of renewable energy in heat generation and transport are still lagging far
behind the goals. Dr Fatih Birol, IEA’s
executive director, said: “We
need to do more to put the world on track to meet all SDG7 targets. I am
particularly concerned by the dramatic lack of access to reliable, modern and
sustainable energy in certain parts of the world, especially in sub-Saharan
Africa, a region where we need to really concentrate our efforts. “The IEA will
continue to cooperate with countries and organizations to make sure that
successful solutions are efficiently deployed so that the sustainable energy revolution
leaves no one behind.”The report tracks global, regional and country progress on
the three targets of SDG7: access to energy and clean cooking, renewable energy
and energy efficiency. It identifies priorities for action and best practices that have proven successful in helping policymakers and development partners understand what is needed to overcome challenges.Here are the key highlights for each target. Findings are
based on official national-level data and measure global progress through 2017.Access to
electricity: Following a decade of steady progress, the global
electrification rate reached 89% and 153 million people gained access to
electricity each year. Access to
electricity:However, the biggest challenge remains in the most remote
areas globally and in sub-Saharan Africa where 573 million people still live in
the dark. To connect the poorest and hardest to reach households, off-grid
solutions, including solar lighting, solar home systems, and increasingly mini
grids, will be crucial. Globally, at least 34 million people in 2017 gained access
to basic electricity services through off-grid technologies. The report also
reinforces the importance of reliability and affordability for sustainable
energy access.Clean Cooking:
Almost three billion people remain without access to clean cooking in 2017,
residing mainly in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. This lack of clean cooking
access continues to pose serious health and socioeconomic concerns. Clean Cooking:Under current and planned policies, the number of people
without access would be 2.2 billion in 2030, with significant impact on health,
environment, and gender equality.Renewables accounted
for 17.5% of global total energy consumption in 2016 versus 16.6% in 2010.
Renewables have been increasing rapidly in electricity generation but have made
less headway into energy consumption for heat and transport. Renewables A substantial further increase of renewable energy is needed
for energy systems to become affordable, reliable and sustainable, focusing on
modern uses. As renewables become mainstream, policies need to cover the
integration of renewables into the broader energy system and take into account
the socio-economic impacts affecting the sustainability and pace of the
transition.Energy efficiency
improvements have been more sustained in recent years, thanks to concerted
policy efforts in large economies. However, the global rate of primary energy
intensity improvement still lags behind, and estimates suggest there has been a
significant slowdown in 2017 and 2018. Energy efficiencyStrengthening mandatory energy efficiency policies,
providing targeted fiscal or financial incentives, leveraging market-based
mechanisms, and providing high-quality information about energy efficiency will
be central to meet the goal.Log in to leave a comment ","May 22, 2019",Nations falling short on meeting SDGs for 2030 on energy access,https://1st4u616hq2s3alsy93h5ipb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/raul-petri-172505-unsplash-electricity-access.jpg

"The City of Cape Town encourages all home and business owners with rooftop solar photovoltaic installations to register both grid-tied and off-grid small-scale embedded generation (SSEG) systems.In an effort to pre-empt national legislation, which will come into effect and require registration, the City has issued a notice requiring registration of solar PV units on or before 31 May 2019.There is no charge for registering, but a non-compliance fee
is payable after the deadline. “Your PV system may also be removed if it does
not meet the prescribed installation standards,” the City acknowledged.According to the City, one of the motivating factors for the regulation is around the safe and responsible use of clean energy. “All solar PV energy systems, which can generate electricity and power your home must comply with the City of Cape Town's regulations and be registered prior to installation,” stated the City. Take the poll: Have you registered your solar PV system?Take the poll:Where the solar PV system has already been installed
residents have been requested to start the registration process immediately.Standalone solar PV units as well as grid-tied systems
connected to the City of Cape Town's electricity network must be registered and
comply with the City's requirements.Notably, the registration does not apply to solar geezers (solar water heaters) as these systems do not generate electricity. The regulation of solar PV systems that feed into a grid and standalone units is to ensure the safety of municipal workers and the general public in terms of proper installation of the systems. The City points out that poorly installed units can cause
household fires and that “the safety and quality of the entire grid may be
compromised if your installation is not compliant”.  The City is also using this requirement as an
opportunity to “grow and maintain the city's electrical infrastructure” as
there is a “need to plan with knowledge of all generation systems on the

Nearly half of global business leaders cited customers as their top source of innovation inspiration (48%) with employees (36%) ranking second. Consultants (10%) and think tanks (7%) lag far behind in the minds of respondents. The importance of keeping this key constituency happy is a focal point with nearly one in five respondents citing customer experience as their primary business area most needing innovation now. This ranks ahead of products, data/business intelligence and technology. According to additional YPO Global Pulse findings, location, geographic location, industry, company size, and length of job tenure greatly inform business leaders’ opinions and go-forward innovation action plans: The YPO 2019 Global Pulse Innovation Survey of its members was conducted by YPO from 29 April – 6 May via an online questionnaire with a representative probability sample of 1,661 YPO members. The sample included members in 105 countries and representing 34 industry sectors. The questionnaire was in English. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 2.3 percentage points at the 95% confidence level.

"South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has signed the Carbon Tax Act into law, which will come into effect from 1 June 2019. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has signed the Carbon Tax Act into law, which will come into effect from 1 June 2019. The Southern African Energy Efficiency Confederation (SAEEC) said in April that it is apparent that phase 1 of the carbon tax will penalise companies whose primary source of emission is energy generation.  Therefore, the SAEEC states that the “obvious conclusion is that using less energy will be essential to reducing the greenhouse gas emissions and the consequent steep tax for heavy emitters”. The SAEEC added that in addition to the carbon tax ‘stick’, there is the ‘carrot’ in the form of the section 12L tax incentive for energy efficiency. Section 12L benefits companies that implement energy efficiency interventions to decrease their energy intensity and employ Measurement and Verification (M&V) to quantify the energy savings for the purpose of a tax allowance.The section 12L tax incentive is currently at 95c/kWh for energy savings.

and recycling trade fair.South Africa’s water
treatment sector has the collective knowledge, technology and capacity to solve
the country’s water and wastewater treatment crisis in as little as three
years, according to stakeholders set to participate in the IFAT water treatment
and recycling trade fair.South Africa’s dams, rivers, wastewater systems and water
distribution systems are in a dire state, but the solutions to these challenges
are readily available within the country. This is according to water sector experts who were speaking
ahead of IFAT Africa, the water, sewage refuse and recycling industry’s key
annual trade fair and conference, which is set to take place in Johannesburg in
July 2019.Unless urgent action is taken, South Africa’s looming water
crisis will prove far more devastating than the power crisis, potentially
crippling the economy and costing lives, noted Eric Bruggeman, CEO of the South
African Capital Equipment Export Council (SACEEC), which endorses IFAT. Bruggeman highlighted that: “The majority of our dams, water
treatment facilities and wastewater systems are over 30 years old, with some as
old as 100 years. Inadequate maintenance has been done in the past 20 years and
the population has virtually doubled since this infrastructure was installed,
so the existing infrastructure cannot cope with demand.”“As an arid country, we have to provide more dams in catchment areas and maximize the water we have. On top of that, leaks, contamination and a failure to recycle water mean we are losing a large proportion of the available water. The situation is frightening,” he stated.Bruggeman continued: “To address the situation, an incredible amount of work must be done on
maintenance, storage capacity must be upgraded and increased, new dams must be
built and ageing pipes must be re-laid. Sewage must be addressed – you can’t
have effluent running through the streets and into the dams. Water should be the top priority from national down to municipal level, Bruggeman urged.WATCH this video to learn more about the solutions available.WATCH this video to learn more about the solutions available.However, in
the face of a lack of resources, the public sector needs to be looking to the
private sector for assistance. “Budget
must be made available and the private sector should be allocated the projects.
With the right budget, the private sector could fix the problems in under three
years,” he said.Chemical
engineer Annejan Visser, a process engineer in business development for Quality
Filtration Systems (QFS), underlined that while the country is in dire need of
solutions, too much time and effort is being dedicated to an outdated
consulting, brick and mortar civil approach to water treatment. “Solutions
are now available in South Africa that could address water treatment problems
far faster and much more cost effectively,” according to Visser. He noted
that South Africa has a highly competitive and advanced water and wastewater
treatment sector, with the skills, capacity and technologies to overcome the
country’s water challenges. “If the
funding was channelled into action, and our private sector stakeholders were
mobilised, collectively, we could probably overcome water and wastewater
treatment challenges in as little as one to three years,” said Visser.Log in to leave a comment ","May 24, 2019",Proposed solutions to curb South Africa’s water crisis,https://1st4u616hq2s3alsy93h5ipb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/water-access.jpg

"Last week, Vestas wind turbines and components arrived at Port Autonome de Dakar for West Africa's first large-scale wind farm. Last week, Vestas wind turbines and components arrived at Port Autonome de Dakar for West Africa's first large-scale wind farm. The wind turbines will be transported by road for delivery of generation equipment for Senegal's Parc Eolien Taiba N’Diaye (PETN) wind farm project. Privately-owned UK renewable power company Lekela expects the wind farm, located in Taiba Ndiaye, about 100km from Senegal’s capital Dakar, to reach 158.7MW by 2020.Once constructed, the wind farm will consist of 46 Vestas wind turbines that
can produce 3.45MW each. They will utilise a 117 metre tubular steel tower and
have blade length of 61.7 metre, giving a large swept area of 12,469m2.
According to Lekela, these diameters allow the wind turbines to maximise the amount of energy captured from the wind. The project is recorded as the largest such project in West Africa that will supply nearly a sixth of Senegal’s power generation.President Macky Sall is keen to make Senegal a leader in renewables in Africa, with a 30% target for clean energy in the coming years, of which this project will provide half, reported Reuters. A smaller solar project underway aims to produce 30MW.""On the environmental level, Senegal has never had a project on this
scale,"" said Massaer Cisse, Lekela's Senegal head. ""This farm will
avoid...300,000 tonnes of carbon emissions.""The 200 billion CFA franc ($342 million) farm will be roughly half financed by
Lekela, and the other half split between US-based Overseas Private Investment
Corporation and Danish export credit company EKF.Renewables currently make up a tiny portion of Africa's power generation,
but several projects aim to increase that share. South Africa, Morocco and
Tunisia are all developing industrial-scale wind farms.On Thursday [23 May], the unassembled parts of the 46 white wind turbines were delivered to the Dakar port, ready to be shipped to the 40-hectare farm.According to Cisse, as part of the project, young locals will be trained in electrical engineering and computer science to help with Senegal's chronic unemployment.

Enabled by the 2018 Public-Private Partnership Proclamation, this programme reflects a new way of doing business in the energy sector in Ethiopia - transitioning from continued public-financing towards private sector led competitively tendered procurement of new renewable generation capacity.  The programme is fully aligned with the World Bank’s Country
Partnership framework for FY18—FY22. It will foster structural transformation for growth by
enhancing private sector financing of infrastructure projects; build resilience
and inclusiveness by increasing supply of electricity sustainably and help to
manage the impact of climate change through diversification of energy sources.“With the support of the World Bank Group, this programme
will create a platform for much-needed private sector participation in the
crucial energy sector by lowering the risks of investing in Ethiopia,”

approach, the World Bank Group’s support to Ethiopia’s IPP programme follows a
sequenced approach under which financing and technical assistance for policy
reforms have unlocked significant opportunities for private sector
participation in the power sector. The Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP)
provided support in terms of resource mapping and validation, as well as

"With nuclear power facing an uncertain future in many countries, the world risks a steep decline in its use in advanced economies that could result in billions of tonnes of additional carbon emissions, according to a new report by the International Energy Agency (IEA).With nuclear power facing an uncertain future in many countries, the world risks a steep decline in its use in advanced economies that could result in billions of tonnes of additional carbon emissions, according to a new report by the International Energy Agency (IEA).Nuclear is the second-largest low-carbon power source in the
world today, accounting for 10% of global electricity generation. It is second only to hydropower at 16%. For advanced economies – including the US, Canada, EU states and Japan – nuclear has been the biggest low-carbon source of electricity for more than 30 years and remains so today. It plays an important role in electricity security in
several countries.However, the future of nuclear power is uncertain as ageing plants are beginning to close in advanced economies, partly because of policies to phase them out but also as a result of economic and regulatory factors. Without policy changes, advanced economies could lose 25% of their nuclear capacity by 2025 and as much as two-thirds of it by 2040, according to the new report, Nuclear Power in a Clean Energy System.In the video below: Minister of Energy Jeff Radebe underlines the inclusion of nuclear in South Africa's energy mixIn the video below: Minister of Energy Jeff Radebe underlines the inclusion of nuclear in South Africa's energy mix“Without an important contribution from nuclear power, the
global energy transition will be that much harder,” said Dr Fatih Birol, the
IEA’s executive director. “Alongside renewables, energy efficiency and other
innovative technologies, nuclear can make a significant contribution to
achieving sustainable energy goals and enhancing energy security. But unless
the barriers it faces are overcome, its role will soon be on a steep decline
worldwide, particularly in the US, Europe and Japan.”The lack of further lifetime extensions of existing nuclear
plants and new projects could result in an additional 4 billion tonnes of CO2
emissions.Some countries have opted out of nuclear power in light of
concerns about safety and other issues. Many others, however, still see a role for nuclear in their
energy transitions but are not doing enough to meet their goals, according to
the report.With its mission to cover all fuels and technologies, the
IEA hopes that the publication of its first report addressing nuclear power in
nearly two decades will help bring the topic back into the global energy
debate. The new report finds that extending the operational life of
existing nuclear plants requires substantial capital investment. But its cost
is competitive with other electricity generation technologies, including new
solar and wind projects, and can lead to a more secure, less disruptive energy
transition.A sharp decline in nuclear power capacity in advanced
economies would have major implications. Without additional lifetime extensions
and new builds, achieving key sustainable energy goals, including international
climate targets, would become more difficult and expensive.“Policy makers hold the key to nuclear power’s future,” Dr
Birol said. He added: “Electricity market design must value the
environmental and energy security attributes of nuclear power and other clean
energy sources. Governments should recognise the cost-competitiveness of safely
extending the lifetimes of existing nuclear plants.”Log in to leave a comment ","May 28, 2019",Global energy transition will be harder without nuclear,https://1st4u616hq2s3alsy93h5ipb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Nuclear.jpg
"South Africa’s first ever climate risk-related resolution will see shareholders vote on a policy at Standard Bank’s Annual General Meeting on Thursday 30 May 2019.South Africa’s first ever climate risk-related resolution will see shareholders vote on a policy at Standard Bank’s Annual General Meeting on Thursday 30 May 2019.Resolution
10 in Standard Bank’s Notice
of AGM was proposed by activist shareholders, the RAITH
Foundation and Theo Botha, with support from responsible investment and
shareholder activism NGO Just Share. If more than 50% of Standard Bank’s shareholders
vote for Resolution 10 on 30 May,
the bank will have to:a)  provide shareholders with more meaningful information about the climate-related risks they are exposed to by investing in the bank, through the bank’s lending, investing and financing activities in relation to fossil fuels; andb)  adopt and publicly disclose a policy on lending to coal-fired power projects and coal mining operations.Read the full Standard Bank shareholder information and notice of annual general meeting here.Around the world, shareholder climate risk-related resolutions have become one of the most powerful tools for raising awareness about climate change risk, and for driving the business and financial sectors to take action to understand, mitigate and avoid that risk. South
Africa is one of the world’s biggest carbon emitters, and many of the biggest
companies listed on the JSE are extremely carbon-intensive. This means they
emit huge quantities of greenhouse gases. Many of the financial institutions
that invest in these high carbon emitters and lend money to them are themselves
listed companies. However, thus far South Africa’s investment industry has done far too little to tackle the climate risks inherent in the investment portfolios of millions of investors, including everyone in the country who has a pension fund.Standard Bank describes itself as the “leading oil and gas bank in sub-Saharan Africa”. In other words, it is heavily involved in lending money to fossil fuel development and extraction across Africa. Every rand invested by banks in fossil fuel projects increases climate risk and makes it harder to achieve a just transition to a low-carbon economy.. In essence, the resolution is only asking the bank to provide shareholders with more information about its fossil fuel lending and risk exposure. However, the Bank's board stated it does not ""consider the proposed resolutions as providing shareholders with any more meaningful understanding of the company’s climate change risk exposure and risk management, and does not believe the proposed resolutions to be in the best interests of the group at this time. Therefore, the board recommends that shareholders vote against these resolutions"". The shareholder climate risk-related resolution would not require the bank to change anything in terms of actual lending practices. There are many banks around the world which are already disclosing this information. Asset
managers and asset owners who claim to be responsible investors will, for the
first time in relation to a South African company, have to take action which
will indicate how serious they really are about engaging with climate risk in
their investment decision-making. Many
of South Africa’s institutional investors are signatories to and/or have
publically declared support for responsible investment initiatives like the
Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) and the Code for Responsible
Investment South Africa (CRISA). This vote will demonstrate how seriously they take these commitments, states JustShare. In
South Africa, where we are still so heavily reliant on fossil fuels for energy,
climate risk and the transition to a low-carbon economy pose unprecedented
risks and opportunities for our society and economy. The
financial sector has a crucial role to play in driving this transition. Banks
should already, at the very least, be disclosing the extent to which they are
exposing their businesses, shareholders, and the planet to climate risk via
their financing of fossil fuels. Info

"The second Economic Update for Mauritania published by the World Bank shows economic growth rising from 3% in 2017 to 3.6% in 2018, owing to Government’s fiscal prudence and reforms.The second Economic Update for Mauritania published by the World Bank shows economic growth rising from 3% in 2017 to 3.6% in 2018, owing to Government’s fiscal prudence and reforms.The report 'Improving the Business Climate to Promote the Development of the Private Sector' points out the role the Mauritanian government’s fiscal prudence and reforms played in restoring macroeconomic balance. 'Improving the Business Climate to Promote the Development of the Private Sector'Samer Matta, World Bank economist and main author of the report, explained: “The reforms generated tax revenue gains estimated at some 0.7% and 0.8% of GDP in 2017 and 2018.” Yet despite these positive developments, the labour market has deteriorated and remains marked by a huge gender divide, youth marginalization, and informal employment. The banking sector also suffers from certain weaknesses that the Government is endeavouring to solve.The Bank said in a statement that the short- and medium-term outlook remains bright with growth projected to increase to an average of 6.2% for the 2019-2021 period, driven by a thriving primary sector, an upturn in mining production, and the development of the GTA gas project. This high growth rate will be accompanied by moderate inflation, fiscal surpluses that will bring the public debt down, and reduced external pressures. Nevertheless, these macroeconomic forecasts are subject to internal and external risks.The report focuses a chapter on recent business climate developments and suggests reforms to promote private sector growth. The reforms conducted in recent years have propelled Mauritania up through the international Doing Business ranking from 176th place in 2015 to 148th in 2019. Yet, as explained by Théodore Anthonioz, private sector specialist and co-author of the report, “despite this significant improvement, there remain some major challenges to be taken up if the business climate is to really stimulate the private sector’s development in Mauritania.”In particular, the report highlights that the main constraint on Mauritanian businesses is access to credit. It therefore recommends that the Government’s future roadmaps for business prioritise access to credit, especially for small and medium enterprises. The World Bank also recommends other reforms for private sector take-off and job creation in Mauritania including action against corruption, which businesses point to as their number two constraint; competition policy reform; membership of a regional integration body; promoting gender equality in legal matters; building human capital; and improving the land policy.Log in to leave a comment ","May 29, 2019",Mauritania to lift structural obstacles hampering private sector development,

partnership has been established to help expand the deployment of energy
storage and bring new technologies to developing countries’ power systems. The Energy Storage Partnership (ESP) comprises the World Bank Group and 29 organisations working together to help develop energy storage solutions tailored to the needs of developing countries.Energy transitions are underway in many countries with a
significant increase in the use of wind and solar power. To integrate these variable renewable resources into grids
at the scale necessary to mitigate climate change, energy storage will be key. The increased use of wind and solar power with storage can help decarbonize power systems, expand energy access, improve grid reliability, and increase energy systems’ resilience.The requirements of developing countries’ grids are not yet
fully considered in the current energy storage market – even though these
countries may have the largest potential for battery deployment. The current battery market is driven by the electric vehicle industry and most mainstream technologies cannot provide long duration storage or withstand harsh climatic conditions and low operation and maintenance capacity.Watch the video below, which delves deeper into the subject of battery storageWatch the video below, which delves deeper into the subject of battery storage“The fast growth we’re seeing in the electric vehicle market is exactly what we need for energy storage in power systems around the world,” said Riccardo Puliti, senior director for energy and extractives at the World Bank. Puliti added: “We want to see batteries connected to the
grid, serving mini-grids, and enabling much more use of renewable power from
the sun and wind.“This is why we are convening the Energy Storage Partnership
and we are honored to work with the partners who have joined this initiative.
We’re looking forward to having more partners join the effort.”To enable the rapid uptake of variable renewable energy in developing countries, the World Bank Group is convening an Energy Storage Partnership (ESP) that will foster international cooperation on:Energy Storage Partnership (ESP)By connecting stakeholders and sharing international
experiences in deploying energy storage solutions, the ESP will help bring new
technological and regulatory solutions to developing countries, as well as help
develop new business models that leverage the full range of services that
storage can provide. The ESP will take a holistic, technology-neutral approach by
including all forms of energy storage, including batteries. The ESP will help expand the global market for energy storage, leading to technology improvements and accelerating cost reductions over time.Watch this Webinar recording on Battery storage: Africa’s energy metals market and supply chainFrank Des Rosiers, the chairperson of the Mission Innovation Steering Committee, commented: “Mission Innovation was born out of a global commitment to accelerate clean energy innovation, to make clean energy widely affordable and accessible.

South African non-profit civil action organisation OUTA welcomes the retention of Tito Mboweni and Pravin Gordhan but is sceptical about the placement of Gwede Mantashe to head up the merged energy and mineral resources ministry. President Ramaphosa’s new Cabinet is faced with the daunting task of putting the country on a positive path. However, the compromises he has had to make in some of the appointments illustrate the huge difficulties ahead to rebuild South Africa and eradicate state capture.It’s a relief to see the Cabinet reduced in size, which addresses the issue of “ministries for political reward”, states OUTA. “However, we would have hoped for an equal reduction in the number of deputy ministers. Nonetheless, the real test for financial stability will be in focused oversight of the departments.”“Both are important for continuing the crucial clean-up and for international credibility, which has already been reflected in the small gain in the rand against the dollar after the announcement. The appointment of Gordhan, in particular, sends a signal of strong leadership and a President who is able to resist populist pressure on Cabinet appointments,” OUTA said in a statement.However, the organisation added that the retention of David Mabuza as Deputy President was expected but remains concerning. “We welcome the retention of Tito Mboweni and Pravin Gordhan, as two of the most important appointments,” states OUTA. Equally, OUTA has stated that it does not believe that Gwede Mantashe’s appointment to a merged Energy and Mineral Resource will deal effectively with the critical need to develop a modern, sustainable energy system.

Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma has been effective in some of her previous roles and is now faced with the great challenge of fixing COGTA. Her structured approach should help in holding local government to account.”OUTA stated that it would be monitoring Blade Nzimande’s performance in Higher Education. “We hope that he will rekindle the plan to review of the Sector Education and Training Authorities (SETAs), where looting appears entrenched and unchallenged.”The retention of Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams in Communications is worrying, as she had achieved little but conflict over the SABC, stated OUTA.The outsider Patricia de Lille is an unexpected and interesting choice; she now has the challenge of a massive Public Works and Infrastructure portfolio, where huge contracts created opportunities for looting.OUTA is intrigued by the appointment of Fikile Mbalula as the country’s seventh Minister of Transport since the e-toll decision was announced over a decade ago in 2008. We trust that the new Minister will do the right thing, engage with civil society and find a lasting resolution to the e-tolls debacle.We welcome the President’s promise that his team’s performance will be “closely monitored against specific outcomes” and that where implementation is unsatisfactory, action will be taken.Now that the new Cabinet has finally been appointed, the hard work of rebuilding South Africa begins.

However, on testing the water in early 2018, we highlighted the problems with raw feed water studies numerous times. Before the tender documents were issued, both the City management as well as the consulting engineer were also informed about the raw water contamination by UWC,” said Herman Smit, MD of QFS.“As far as we are aware, neither the City or IX engineers, as the consulting engineers, did any water characterisation of the raw seawater, and denied there was anything wrong with the quality of the input water during the contract process, or once the desalination plant had been commissioned,” added Smit.Smit continued: “As a local SME, who came forward during Day Zero to assist with the water crisis, we feel taken advantage of by the City who is using its financial and legal power to silence us to hide the gross mismanagement of the desalination projects.”QFS will continue with
the legal process and sue the City for the contractual amount as well as
damages incurred during the 13 months of dispute. “I believe that the City
was aware of untreated sewage in the sea around Cape Town and are now avoiding
responsibility and trying to lay the blame at QFS’s door,” he added.Smit emphasised that had the City advised QFS of the poor state of the seawater and the extraordinary levels of contamination, of which the City was aware, the plant tendered would have been designed to deal with the quality of the inflow water and the company would not now be faced with this stand-off.“We cannot understand
the City’s position: not acknowledging the water quality and working with
service providers to solve the problem; keeping their side of the contract
agreement and paying QFS what is owed; being unwilling to come to the table to
work out a solution; trying to avoid mediation to solve the stand-off; taking
unreasonable measures to prevent the release of the mediation report; and
claiming confidentiality when information is required,” Smit concluded.Story source: Green Building Africa and edited by ESI AfricaLog in to leave a comment ","May 31, 2019",Construction of desalination plant result in dispute in Cape Town,

Renewable power is the cheapest source of electricity in many parts of the world today, the latest report from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) shows. The report contributes to the international discussion on
raising climate action worldwide, ahead of Abu Dhabi’s global preparatory meeting
for the United Nations Climate Action Summit in September.With prices set to fall, the cost advantage of renewables will extend further, Renewable Power Generation Costs in 2018 says, based on a comprehensive review of data from projects around the world. This will strengthen the business case and solidify the role of renewables as the engine of the global energy transformation. “Renewable power is the backbone of any development that aims to be sustainable”, said IRENA’s Director-General, Francesco La Camera. “We must do everything we can to accelerate renewables if we
are to meet the climate objectives of the Paris Agreement. Today’s report sends
a clear signal to the international community: Renewable energy provides
countries with a low-cost climate solution that allows for scaling up
action. “To fully harness the economic opportunity of renewables,
IRENA will work closely with our membership and key partners to facilitate
on-the-ground solutions and concerted action that will result in renewable
energy projects,” La Camera assured.The costs for renewable energy technologies decreased to a record low last year. The global weighted-average cost of electricity from concentrating solar power (CSP) declined by 26%, bioenergy by 14%, solar PV and onshore wind by 13%, hydropower by 12% and geothermal and offshore wind by 1%, respectively.  Cost reductions, particularly for solar and wind power technologies, are set to continue into the next decade, the new report finds. According to IRENA’s global database, over three-quarters of
the onshore wind and four-fifths of the solar PV projects that are due to be
commissioned next year will produce power at lower prices than the cheapest new
coal, oil or natural gas options. Crucially, they are set to do so without
financial assistance.Onshore wind and solar PV costs between three and four US
cents per kilowatt hour are already possible in areas with good resources and
enabling regulatory and institutional frameworks. For example, record-low auction prices for solar PV in Chile, Mexico, Peru, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates have seen a levelised cost of electricity as low as three US cents per kilowatt hour. Electrification on the basis of cost-competitive renewables is the backbone of the energy transformation and a key low-cost decarbonisation solution in support of the climate goals set out in the Paris Agreement.

In a first for South Africa, at Standard Bank’s Annual General Meeting on 30 May climate-conscious shareholders compelled the bank to adopt and publicly disclose a policy on lending to coal-fired power projects and coal mining operations. Resolution 10.2 received 55% of shareholder votes and is therefore binding on the company. This is the first time that a South African bank – or any listed South African company – has faced a shareholder resolution on a climate-related issue. Standard Bank’s board had recommended that shareholders vote against it.  A second part to the climate-related resolution* would have required the
bank to report to shareholders its assessment of the greenhouse gas emissions
resulting from its financing portfolio and its exposure to climate change risk
in its lending, investing and financing activities. While this part of the resolution was at the Standard Bank AGM was not passed, it received significant support with 38% of shareholders voting in favour, indicating strong shareholder demand for climate risk-related disclosure.Tracey Davies, Executive Director of Just Share, says: “We are extremely encouraged by the levels of support for both parts of the resolution. Considering that this was the first time shareholders in SA have had to vote on such a resolution, and also that the board recommended that they vote against it, the results are significant.”She added: “They show that there is a broad section of our investment community which understands the importance of acting on climate risk. We commend the shareholders who voted in favour of the resolution, like Mergence Investment Managers, Old Mutual, Aeon Investment Management and many others who were bold enough to support the resolutions and provide the climate leadership that is so desperately needed within SA’s financial and business sector.""The Just Share executive encourages other shareholders who voted in favour of the resolution to publicly declare that they did so. In South Africa, where we are still so heavily reliant on fossil fuels for
energy, climate risk and the transition to a low-carbon economy pose
unprecedented risks and opportunities for our society and economy. The
financial sector has a crucial role to play in driving this transition and
today’s developments prove that institutional investors are starting to demand
it do so.Banks should already, at the very least, be disclosing the extent to which they are exposing their businesses, shareholders, and the planet to climate risk via their financing of fossil fuels.Shareholder resolutions have become one of the most powerful tools for raising awareness about climate change risk, and for forcing the business and financial sectors to take action to mitigate and avoid that risk. It is very encouraging that so many investors have supported the call for better climate risk disclosure, and we hope that others will consider proposing and supporting more such resolutions at the upcoming AGMs of South African companies.

"The increasing number of wind energy projects underway in South Africa is opening the market for specialist expertise in lifting turbine blades safely and securely. The increasing number of wind energy projects underway in South Africa is opening the market for specialist expertise in lifting turbine blades safely and securely. There are now a dozen more renewable energy projects underway in South Africa, which together will need the erection of 465 wind turbines during the construction phase of Bid Window 4 of the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producers Procurement Programme (REIPPPP).According to Johnson Renew general manager, Cornelis Grotius, the lifting specialist company has already secured crane services contracts at four wind farm projects, namely Golden Valley in the Eastern Cape, Excelsior in the Western Cape, Kangnas in the Northern Cape and Perdekraal in the Western Cape.“Add to our considerable experience in the renewable energy
sector, is the fact that we now have three 750 ton Liebherr LG 1750 lattice
boom mobile cranes, which offer enormous benefits on these projects,” states
Grotius. Grotius also highlights the importance of detailed engineering when planning each lift, and having the specialised skills and fit-for-purpose equipment, to meet the range of challenges when commissioned for lighting turbine blades. The turbine hubs weigh some 30 tonnes and each of the three
blades are up to 15 tonnes.“With tower sections weighing up to 81 tonnes, the nacelles up to 97 tonnes, and drivetrains about 60 tonnes, it is vital to have the right systems, equipment and expertise to lift safely every time,” he emphasised. While the weight and size of the componentry is a key focus,
so is the wind factor on site. Working in windy areas heightens the need for
high-tech modelling and upfront engineering, especially when lifting turbine
blades. “The lifting studies we do for each lift specify the maximum wind speed in which we can operate, and our safety protocol ensures we adhere to these limits,” states Grotius. “However, to get the job done on schedule, we have the flexibility and resources to work through the night if necessary, when wind speeds are lower.”Johnson Renew was set up in 2015 to focus on renewable energy projects and has worked with various stakeholders to transport, lift and assemble hundreds of wind turbines around South Africa and Namibia.Now read this: China installs tallest wind turbineLog in to leave a comment ","June 3, 2019","Lifting turbine blades requires experience, says Johnson Renew",https://1st4u616hq2s3alsy93h5ipb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Johnson-Crane-Hires-LG-1750-lattice-boom-mobile-crane.jpg

Given peat’s carbon intensity, due to its lower calorific value than coal, this volume of output offsets some of the drop off in emissions from coal’s decline, Cornwall Insight Ireland noted. Joe Camish, an analyst at Cornwall Insight Ireland, said: “The current 30-day run of no-coal fired generation in Ireland shows the changing nature of the generation mix in the country. However, the continued presence of peat dampens the full decarbonisation impact of coal being out of the picture.""Read more: Rwanda: Gishoma peat to power plant will resume operationsAccording to Camish, this is unlikely to be a long-lasting feature of the mix. ""The market continues to shift. Policy changes and policy-driven renewable deployment may lead to deteriorating economics for peat plants. For example, rising EU ETS carbon prices, cheaper gas and closer to zero marginal cost renewables could all reduce Peat’s current contribution to the Irish generation mix.""Camish added: “Already, the pressure is starting to be felt in the form of the elimination of the annual industry subsidies for peat-fired generation ceasing by the end of this year, with this year totalling €65.5mn.

Read more: New programme to fast-track adoption of offshore wind energyThe project’s first operational team of 32 set sail on Friday [31 May] from Grimsby Royal Docks to the wind farm, 120km out to sea. They are part of two shift-based teams that are responsible for operating and maintaining the wind farm, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, throughout its 25-year life-span. The huge scale of the project means that operations are beginning before construction is complete. To date, over 50 of the 174 Siemens Gamesa 7MW turbines are operational, and turbine installation is expected to continue until late summer.When fully operational next year, the wind farm will be able to power well over a million UK homes with clean electricity.UK Energy and Clean Growth Minister Chris Skidmore said: “The start of operations at the world’s largest wind farm at Hornsea One is an important milestone and yet another example of British innovation and the UK’s leadership in offshore wind. “We already have the largest installed offshore wind capacity in the world, and once fully up and running this wind farm will provide enough power for one million more homes, putting us well on the way to our target of a third of the UK’s electricity coming from offshore wind by 2030.”Morten Holm, Hornsea One’s head of operations, said: “Hornsea One changes the game in the way we produce clean electricity around the globe. It’s the first of a new generation of offshore wind farms, that are much bigger than anyone has ever attempted to build before.“The speed of construction has been phenomenal, and it’s thanks to the hundreds of dedicated people working on the project, that the project is on schedule to eventually generate enough clean electricity for over a million homes across the UK. It’s an exciting moment for me personally, but also for the UK as the world watches the progress with this record-breaking wind farm.”David Coussens, the deputy operations manager for Hornsea One, and leading the first operational team shift, said: “Operating a wind farm this far offshore is unprecedented. We’ve had to think creatively and come up with new ways of working to overcome the logistical and technical challenges of operating a massive power station 120km from the shore, about the same distance as Grimsby to Leeds!   “A big part of this is our people, and ensuring offshore life is as comfortable as possible for them.

It is reported that the company would potentially cut 792
out of 1,900 jobs at the gas power unit, and possibly 252 other support
positions.The remaining reductions also would occur mainly at Belfort, which handles gas, steam, nuclear and hydro technology, the company said.In response to this development, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said he would fight to save jobs at one of the firm's factories in eastern France.“We are ready to fight alongside you ... and local
politicians and obviously alongside GE workers to ensure the industrial future
of the GE site,” said Le Maire.The company presented its plans to French union officials on Tuesday. The company maintains that the proposals “are in line with the company’s intention to improve operational and financial performance of its gas activities"".Reuters reported that French industrial group Alstom was
Belfort’s biggest employer until 2014 when it sold its gas turbine
manufacturing business to GE, which pledged to create 1,000 jobs to win backing
for the deal from the French government.However, that commitment fell short as the gas turbine power
plant market collapsed. General Electric has created only 25 jobs, and in February agreed to pay $56 million into a reindustrialisation fund for falling short of the target.

The South African government signed long-pending PPAs in April 2018, which helped independent power producers (IPPs) to announce final investment decisions, according to new research from Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables.As noted in the report, 'Africa wind power market outlook 2019', construction activity in South Africa will peak at more than 1GW of capacity in 2020 and 2021 as developers race to operationalise projects that were awarded through bidding window 4 in 2015. In the longer term, the country's Integrated Resource Plan is expected to target more than 10GW of additional wind power capacity through 2030, while President Cyril Ramaphosa’s proposed reforms for the power sector will create a more favourable environment for renewable energy deployment.""Africa’s most industrialised economy, South Africa, boasts its largest wind power market, with 2.1GW of operational capacity as of Q1 2019,” noted Sohaib Malik, Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables Senior Analyst.Malik continued: “Issues
with governance that took place in 2016 and 2017 were bad news for the local
wind market, as no new additions were recorded in 2018. However, installations
are expected to recommence in 2019 with 130MW of new capacity additions on tap,
though potential project delays jeopardise that capacity and limit any upside
potential for additional capacity. Growth prospects improve thereafter, with
more than 1GW of capacity expected in 2020 and 2021 combined.“This outlook is supported
by ongoing construction activity, peaking in 2020 as IPPs race to achieve
commercial operations.”Developers only
commissioned projects in four markets in Africa during 2018.Malik highlighted some wind turbine manufacturers successes from last year including the 310MW Lake Turkana project in Kenya, the largest single installation on the African continent. Nareva Holding built
the 205MW Aftissat wind project, utilising SGRE turbines. “Lastly, the New and
Renewable Energy Authority (NREA) of Egypt commissioned the final segment of
its Gulf of El-Zayt extension, adding 120MW of capacity in 2018. Cumulative
wind power capacity in Africa stood at 5.5GW by the end of 2018,” he stated.“Africa’s wind project
pipeline stands at 18GW as of Q1 2019. The project realisation rate, however,
remains low in the region due to a host of challenges faced by developers,” Malik
pointed out. As some governments took measures to address
these issues, the regional market is expected to recover and grow exponentially
between 2019 and 2021. “This growth is underpinned by a five-fold increase year-on-year in turbine order intake in 2018 and 6.5GW of wind capacity in advanced stages of development. The scale of the development pipeline underlines the ability of the continent’s largest wind markets to grow in a sustained manner, providing a blueprint for emerging markets to tap their wind potential and fuel economic growth,” added Malik. Inconsistent policy
measures have historically plagued wind market growth in Africa, however that
is beginning to change.According to Malik,
there’s a growing momentum behind the development of long-term incentive
mechanisms to support the regional wind market. “Competitive
procurement has proven to be the favoured tool of policy support, with South
Africa and Morocco introducing auction programs in 2011 and 2015, respectively.“Tunisia solicited bids for wind IPPs in 2017, while Kenya and Ethiopia are contemplating the launch of auctions for future installations. These developments mirror global trends where competitive procurement regimes have resulted in lower tariffs in many countries. Notably, this trend may be less impactful in emerging markets, which are expected to grow by less than 800MW of capacity through 2028, as auction volumes may not be sufficient to draw the attention of global wind industry leaders,"" stated Malik.Another interesting development: Largest offshore wind farm kicks into operationsLog in to leave a comment ","June 6, 2019",2018: A good year for wind turbine manufacturers in Africa,https://1st4u616hq2s3alsy93h5ipb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/wind-power.jpg

"To move trade across African borders, the President of the African Development Bank (AfDB) said the Bank has invested around $1 billion through various initiatives, including cross border infrastructure. To move trade across African bordersthe President of the African Development Bank (AfDB) said the Bank has invested around $1 billion through various initiatives, including cross border infrastructure. Most has gone to small and medium enterprises – the engine of economic growth. Speaking to journalists prior to the Bank’s 2019 Annual Meetings, due to open today in Malabo, Equatorial Guinea,  Akinwumi Adesina said:  “If we get integration right, Africa can develop with dignity and confidence.""The theme of this year’s meetings is ‘Regional Integration for Africa’s Economic Prosperity'. Regional integration gained momentum with the agreement on the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) in March 2018 and is now at the threshold of its launch next month.The AfCFTA will constitute the world’s largest free trade area, consolidating an integrated market of 1.3 billion consumers with a combined gross domestic product (GDP) of about $3.4 trillion. It is estimated that Africa’s GDP growth could reach 6% a year in a continent without borders (UNECA).Cesar A. Mba Abogo, Equatorial Guinea’s Minister of Finance and Economic Planning, who co-hosted the press conference, spoke about the country’s significant efforts on the economic and infrastructure front, to connect markets in Central Africa.“It is a real privilege to host the Bank’s Annual Meetings… the Bank’s High 5s – are very much in line with our development strategy between now and 2025,” Abogo said, revealing that the country’s road networks both in Malabo and throughout the mainland, were better than across large parts of Africa. In addition, Equatorial Guinea has invested in social housing and will continue to improve human capital, through capacity building and training programmes, while recognising the challenges presented by skill shortages.Equatorial Guinea had been selected as host of the Annual Meetings because of its economic potential and because Central Africa could benefit a great deal from regional integration, said Adesina.“We believe that the potential is immense, but the level of integration is not enough, ” he said.Regional integration is one of the Bank’s High 5s and is seen as pivotal to boosting Africa’s economic development.The Bank is committed to accelerating Africa’s integration process. In the last five years, the Bank has invested more than $15 billion in the construction of regional infrastructure in energy, transport and ICT. Some of these projects include a $93.8 million loan for the long-awaited Trans-Gambia bridge linking the Gambia and Senegal, resulting in a 50% cut in freight costs and improved transport, health and education services for 900,000 local people.

several international experiences and trends of phasing out coal, and unbundling

the introduction of an independent transmission operator to improve the
security of electricity supply and provide fair access for new renewable power

"A new analysis highlights how European Investment Bank (EIB) financing of fossil fuel projects – in particular, gas pipelines and LNG terminals – is not compatible with EU climate commitments or the aims of the Paris Agreement.A new analysis highlights how European Investment Bank (EIB) financing of fossil fuel projects – in particular, gas pipelines and LNG terminals – is not compatible with EU climate commitments or the aims of the Paris Agreement.The report Gas and the European Investment Bank: Why new gas infrastructure investment is incompatible with climate goals comes as the EIB is considering new limits to fossil fuel finance in its energy lending policy.  As the world's largest multilateral lender, the EIB has faced growing pressure from civil society to end their financing of fossil fuels, which averaged more than €2 billion ($2.2 billion) per year between 2013 and 2018. Their fossil fuel finance topped €2.5
billion in 2018, the bulk of which supported parts of the controversial
Southern Gas Corridor, including the Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) and the
Trans-Anatolian Pipeline (TANAP).The new report, published by Oil Change International, debunks a key argument some of the Bank’s shareholders and the gas industry have used to justify continued finance for gas: that new gas infrastructure can be made climate compatible by converting it to carry so-called non-fossil gas in the future. Read more on: Global gas demand to rise 10% over the next five yearsThe report shows this argument goes against
all eight of the climate action scenarios in the European Commission’s
long-term vision on climate, which would see the future role of gas shrink
considerably, and underscores the serious limitations to non-fossil gas
technologies.The report also analyses the EU’s priority
gas projects – in the list of Projects of Common Interest (PCIs) – and
determines that a substantial majority of the money being spent on them (72%)
is for projects that are inextricably linked to fossil gas sources, and thus
exceedingly unlikely to be converted to carry sources of non-fossil gas.“The EIB and its Member State shareholders
are coming up with creative excuses to keep calling gas a ‘bridge fuel’. But
the science is crystal clear that we need to leave all fossil fuels in the
ground and get on with a just transition to 100% renewable energy,” said Bronwen
Tucker, report co-author and analyst at Oil Change International.The report is being released in conjunction
with an open letter calling for a fossil free EIB signed by more than 70 civil
society organizations and academics. Both have come out just as the EIB's Board
of Governors – comprised of the Ministers of Finance of its EU Member State
shareholders – gather on June 14th in Luxembourg for their annual meeting.The open letter and the report both call on
the EIB’s management to rule out all fossil fuel finance in their new energy
lending policy.“The last time the EIB did this review, in
2013, people all over Europe demands a safe climate future were able to
convince the Bank to end direct finance for coal and increase their funding for
renewables and energy efficiency,” said Tucker.“Looking back, it’s clear that we were
right then, and we’re right today. It’s 2019 and the EIB is lagging behind the
science and its public finance peers like the World Bank Group. Public pressure
is stronger than ever because we are in the midst of a climate emergency, and
we know the EIB must finally stop funding all fossil fuels,” Tucker added.The full report can be downloaded hereThe open letter can be read hereLog in to leave a comment ","June 13, 2019",Energy lending policy review debunks financing fossil fuel,https://1st4u616hq2s3alsy93h5ipb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Climate-finance.jpg

mining companies. These water-dependent industries are key economic growth
engines and major employers in the region and beyond.The main economic
activity in the area is subsistence farming, with cultivated land of two acres
on average per household. Coffee is the major
cash crop grown in the watershed. The cultivated land with slopes of on average
25% in the landscape has been heavily eroded and yields are limited due to
fragile soils and poor farming techniques that exacerbate soil degradation.Through its Technical
Assistance Facility responsAbility supports the restoration project focusing on
protecting important water catchments for socio-economic development as well as
biodiversity conservation. The project uses a
Payments for Watershed Services (PWS) approach-an innovative sustainable
financing mechanism aimed at encouraging private and public sector agencies to
actively engage in supporting and financing ecosystem conservation.The project aims to restore degraded hotspots, mitigate siltation and associated flooding risk and improve water quality and flow variability. Read more on: Proposed solutions to curb South Africa’s water crisisBy mobilising land
owners for Sustainable Land Management (SLM) interventions to increase farm
productivity, the project wants to improve community livelihoods upstream while
at the same time ensuring sustainable water supply to the many users downstream
and beyond. Through this project,
alternative sources of income will be created for the local communities. The
project also supports the Ugandan government’s effort of increasing wealth at
the household level, also related to SDG 1 ‘end poverty in all its forms
everywhere’.Log in to leave a comment ","June 14, 2019",Degraded watershed impacts economic growth,https://1st4u616hq2s3alsy93h5ipb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Water-2.jpg
"Eleven million people were employed in renewable energy worldwide in 2018 according to the latest analysis by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). Eleven million people were employed in renewable energy worldwide in 2018 according to the latest analysis by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). This compares with 10.3 million in 2017[1]. As more and more countries manufacture, trade and install renewable energy technologies, the latest Renewable Energy and Jobs – Annual Review finds that renewables jobs grew to their highest level despite slower growth in key renewable energy markets including China. The diversification of the renewable energy supply chain is changing the sector’s geographic footprint. Until now, renewable energy industries have remained relatively concentrated in a handful of major markets, such as China, the United States and the European Union. Increasingly, however, East and Southeast Asian countries have emerged alongside China as key exporters of solar photovoltaic (PV) panels. Countries including Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam were responsible for a greater share of growth in renewables jobs last year, which allowed Asia to maintain a 60% share of renewable energy jobs worldwide.“Beyond climate goals, governments are prioritising renewables as a driver of low-carbon economic growth in recognition of the numerous employment opportunities created by the transition to renewables,” said Francesco La Camera, Director-General of IRENA.  La Camera added: “Renewables deliver on all main pillars of sustainable development – environmental, economic and social. As the global energy transformation gains momentum, this employment dimension reinforces the social aspect of sustainable development and provides yet another reason for countries to commit to renewables.”Solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind remain the
most dynamic of all renewable energy industries. Accounting for one-third of
the total renewable energy workflow, solar PV retains the top spot in 2018,
ahead of liquid biofuels, hydropower, and wind power. Geographically, Asia
hosts over three million PV jobs, nearly nine-tenths of the global total.Most of the wind industry’s activity still
occurs on land and is responsible for the bulk of the sector’s 1.2 million
jobs. China alone accounts for 44 per cent of global wind employment, followed
by Germany and the United States. Offshore wind could be an especially
attractive option for leveraging domestic capacity and exploiting synergies
with the oil and gas industry. Renewable energy jobs highlights:

" UK power utility SSE is proposing to close the remaining operational units at Fiddler’s Ferry Coal-Fired Power Station citing financial challenges among other reasons. UK power utility SSE is proposing to close the remaining operational units at Fiddler’s Ferry Coal-Fired Power Stationciting financial challenges among other reasons.Fiddler’s Ferry has had limited success in the UK Government’s Capacity Market auctions and its current contract will end in September 2019.  Read more on coal: Pressure mounts on Keter to call off Lamu coal plantIts financial performance has deteriorated to unsustainable levels, with losses around £40 million ($45 million) in SSE’s last financial year and projections for further losses in future years.Following collective consultation on the
proposed closure, SSE stated it will look at options to redeploy employees,
while some will have a continuing role in managing the decommissioning of the
plant and SSE will also offer voluntary redundancy on enhanced terms.Stephen Wheeler, managing director of Thermal Energy at SSE, said: “The proposed closure of SSE’s coal-fired power station at Fiddler’s Ferry is a very difficult decision because of the impact on our employees and contractors at the station, their families and the local community.“Financially, the station is making significant losses and our projections show that this will continue to be the case as the UK looks to phase out coal-fired generation by 2025 at the latest. At nearly 50 years old, the station is unable to compete with more efficient and modern gas and renewable generation.“We have a talented and dedicated team at Fiddler’s Ferry and our priority is to support employees and ensure they have a range of options available to them for the future. SSE is proud of the social and economic contributions the station and our employees have made for the local area and wider society.”The operational units
at Fiddler’s Ferry have a combined capacity of 1,510MW and hold Transmission
Entry Capacity (the right to export power onto the transmission system) of
1,455MW.In pursuit of a
greener power system, Fiddler’s Ferry is SSE’s last
remaining coal-fired power station. As national and international policies
focus on promoting lower-carbon forms of electricity generation in a bid to
tackle climate change, the economics of coal-fired stations have become
increasingly challenged. The UK has committed to ending unabated coal-fired electricity generation by 2025, and this week the government confirmed it would legislate to achieve a net zero carbon emissions target by 2050.We welcome the Government legislating for #netzero – a call we’ve made since last year and ratified by @theCCCuk in May.  #netzero #climateaction #energy https://t.co/VwTbbPPt3mLog in to leave a comment ","June 14, 2019",Closure of Fiddler’s Ferry Coal-Fired Power Station on the cards,https://1st4u616hq2s3alsy93h5ipb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Fiddler’s-Ferry-Coal-Fired-Power-Station.jpg
